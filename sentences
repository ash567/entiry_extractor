Thousands of pending home sales may be in jeopardy unless Congress extends the June num deadline for buyers to close on their deals and claim a tax credit
The Senate on Wednesday approved a threemonth extension giving buyers until Sept num to close but its attached to another bill that still has to be passed by the House
The extension would apply only to buyers that met the April num deadline to have signed purchase contracts in hand
The tax credit is worth up to $num for repeat buyers and up to $num for firsttime buyers
Many pending deals are in danger of not closing by June num because of delays that arent the buyers fault
Some appraisals are taking longer to complete and some lenders have been overwhelmed by a crush of mortgage applications that landed before the tax credit expired April num
Up to num buyers who were hoping to close by June num and get the tax credit are likely to miss the deadline according to the National Association of Realtors NAR
We are hopeful says Paul Bishop vice president of research with NAR
Weve heard a lot of concern from Realtors out there
There seems to be a sense of fairness
The tax credit was essentially promised to those buyers
But some Realtors say even if a threemonth extension is granted that still wont be enough time for buyers pursuing houses through short sales which can take many months to close
How are you going to close a short sale in two months
says Edward Goldfarb a Realtor with Keller Williams in Fort Lauderdale
Hundreds of people are not going to close and are going to lose their tax credit
September is not any better
A short sale can take a year and a half
Another concern is that buyers who face losing the tax credit could pull out of pending deals altogether
Any extension must be passed this week or buyers will start canceling deals next week before the deadline hits says Richard Smith president and CEO of Realogy parent company of Century num ERA Coldwell Banker and Sothebys International Realty
Were concerned as many people are that this will force people to cancel their contracts Smith says
Brian Bonime num has a contract on a home in Margate Fla but is worried the short sale wont close in time to get the $num tax credit he was counting on
Itll put a dent in things financially says Bonime who works in management at a supermarket
The sellers had brand new appliances theyre taking with them and we were going to get the money now so we can get appliances

AIDS prevention advocates are hailing a pill newly shown to protect against HIV as a great tool for disease prevention
But they caution that no drug alone can address social factors blamed for the persistence of the epidemic
And they say concerns remain about who will pay for the costly treatment
A study released Tuesday showed that daily doses of a drug called Truvada already used to treat HIV infection cut the risk of new infections among healthy gay men
Kyriell Noon of the San Franciscobased Stop AIDS Project said any addition to the HIV prevention safety net is good news
But he said factors such as lack of access to education and health care that contribute to higher infection rates do not evaporate when a promising drug comes along
Truvada which costs $num to $num a year in the United States will do little to halt HIVs spread if the only way to get it is to pay out of pocket Noon said
The history of the HIV epidemic in this country has been a story of disparities he said
I would hate to see this new exciting breakthrough enhance those disparities
Noons group was among those that helped recruit participants for the study in San Francisco which has more than one new HIV infection every day according to the citys Department of Public Health
The overall study involved about num men at high risk of HIV infection in Peru Ecuador Brazil South Africa Thailand and the United States San Francisco and Boston
Dr Susan Buchbinder director of the San Francisco health departments HIV research section called the findings on the drug a tremendous step forward
But she took pains to point out that among the several HIV prevention studies she has overseen this latest had especially strict requirements for making sure participants stayed on track
Men taking Truvada had to commit to monthly medical visits and received extensive counseling including reminders about the importance of condoms
Such reminders seemed to have worked During the study risky sex among men taking Truvada declined
But concern exists that in the real world some men will see Truvada as a license to be promiscuous and shed precautions such as condoms
A followup study will track participants who remain on the drug to see if that happens
Advocates say that regardless such worries are why just handing out the drug will not be enough
Our goal is to try to combine prevention interventions Buchbinder said
Its not about just popping a pill every day
Yet for many healthy gay men the question of whether to take a daily dose of Truvada will likely become an important issue
Public health officials say they are working on defining who falls into the highest risk groups who would benefit most from the drug
But Jason Meier num has already made up his mind
The selfdescribed single sexually active gay man from Birmingham Ala said he would ask his doctor for the drug
Meier a student affairs staffer at The University of Alabama at Birmingham said that taking one pill a day before contracting HIV is better than taking multiple pills after becoming infected
Condoms arent num percent safe Meier said
In this day and age you cant trust a partner to be honest about their sexual activity or history
At some point you have to take responsibility for safer sexual practices
Meier said paying for the drug now makes financial sense compared to the expense of postinfection treatment
But broad government or insurance company funding for the drug for prevention rather than treatment would not come before US Food and Drug Administration Approval
Even then funding for the drug as a prevention measure could be divisive in the US if such use is seen as encouraging sexual activity
For now the drugs maker Gilead Sciences Inc is still deciding whether to seek federal approval to market Truvada as a way to prevent HIV infection
In the meantime doctors can prescribe the drug offlabel for that use
But advocates are holding off on recommending that gay men seek out their doctors for prescriptions
I think the bigger question will be will the FDA decide that this study is enough
said Judy Auerbach vice president of research and evaluation for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation
The foundations message to those who ask about the drug will be not to experiment with the drug on your own Auerbach said
She called the drug promising but said all the traditional ways of preventing infection should still be emphasized
If you really want to pursue this go talk to your medical provider and theyll make an assessment
I think thats all we can say at this point

Astronaut Jerry Linenger and architect Eduardo Strauch know the remarkable quality that keeps the trapped Chilean miners going the immense power of hope
Linenger and Strauch are living proof of survival amid isolation
They say that power is in us all
Thirteen years ago Linenger was only a month into his fourmonth expedition on an aging Russian Mir space station when a neardeadly fire broke out
That was the beginning of harrowing experiences that included a nearcrash and an oxygen system that kept breaking down
A return was months away
It was the space equivalent of what the miners may have to face
If the hope is out there hope can get you through that ordeal said Linenger a medical doctor who had two Russian crewmates
I think its a testament to mankind our DNA and our ability to survive
The Aug num collapse of a main shaft of a gold and silver mine that runs like a corkscrew for miles under a northern Chilean mountain trapped the num miners
They could reach many chambers in the depths and lived on two spoonfuls of tuna per person every other day
Their fate was unknown for num days until rescuers drilled a small borehole that allows those on the ground to send emergency supplies and communicate with the trapped people
Strauch was one of num Uruguayan rugby team members who survived a num crash in Chiles Andes mountains and had to wait for num days before being rescued
They forced themselves to eat the flesh of dead friends
Im sure they are going to get out of there Strauch now num said of the miners
In these circumstances the instincts flourish to num percent and from there the human qualities emerge such as confidence in themselves
Strauch who is now an architect in Uruguay said he and his teammates had a goal of just seeing their loved ones again and in this case of the miners its the same
Theres tremendous faith in human beings
Few people have lived through what the num miners are now going through but the closest and most studied analogy is just the opposite of the halfmile underground room where the miners are trapped
It is in space where astronauts and cosmonauts live for as much as a year in cramped quarters and limited contact with friends and family back home
In the past two decades more than num men and women have lived in space for months on end
The Chilean government has asked NASA for advice on life sciences issues and technology that can help the miners and the space agency will do what it can said NASA spokesman Mike Curie
The key is giving them a sense of control of their own destiny said University of Pennsylvania psychiatry professor David Dinges
He has studied astronauts and others and their response to isolation and stress
He is also the only American scientist working on an ambitious numday program in Moscow putting six volunteers in isolation to mimic a moon mission
Hope is a resource in this environment Dinges said especially if the miners are trying to help their own rescue
If they can be an agent of their own rescue that helps enormously
Davitt McAteer who was assistant secretary for mine safety at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration said the biggest threat to the miners may be the stress that comes with being trapped underground for a long period of time
something mine safety officials have studied
This is tough but manageable doable he added
I dare say you or I could do it with help from counselors
unlike the miners they volunteer for lengthy isolation
say there are ways you can survive
Carl Walz who spent six months on the International Space Station said You just have to go and do it and make the best of your situation
The sense that theres no way out its kind of a good thing Linenger told The Associated Press
He said it focuses people on fighting the problem not each other and doing what has to be done
Walz who had no crisis on his mission but was isolated said the key for him was really staying busy figuring out a routine and staying with that routine
Thats more important than it sounds psychiatrist Dinges said
Its not just keeping people busy but some kind of psychologically meaningful work
Dinges said the miners also need to keep track of time in a normal way if possible even celebrating birthdays
It sounds crazy but things that allow you to organize maintains some semblance of human life Dinges said
Another issue that Walz and Linenger raise is a tough one for num people trapped in an area the size of a living room personal space
Linenger responded to isolation by retreating at times to a corner of Mir
This is critical psychologically because youve got to give people something thats theirs Dinges said
Once you give them that space God help anyone who touches it
And that leads to potential clashes among a group a major issue with num people Dinges said
The answer he said is not to allow disgruntled people to contaminate the psychological character of a group
Linenger is more optimistic Survival and weareinthistogether trumps everything
Linenger said he could live with the glitches the threats the loneliness on Mir
What he had difficulty with was the broken promises
When he was told he could speak to his wife he thought of little else for a week
Then there was a communication problem
All he got was static
The unmet expectation is the worst crushing blow you can get Linenger said
The biggest mistake you can possibly make is say youll be down there next week and not show up
When the miners come up theyll experience a new feeling of fresh air and freedom that Linenger recalls with fondness You just appreciate the fundamental elemental things of the Earth
And they are going to have that same sensation

Shares of drug developer Vical Inc plunged to a numweek low Wednesday after a drug discovered by Vical failed in a late stage clinical trial
THE SPARK SanofiAventis SA said NVnumFGF did not reach its main goal in the study
It was testing the drug as a treatment for critical limb ischemia or blockages in the arteries of the legs
SanofiAventis said the study showed that NVnumFGF was no better than a placebo in preventing limb amputation or death one year after treatment
NVnumFGF is a genetic drug designed to encourage the growth of new blood vessels
In the trial it was tested on patients who could not have revascularization procedures
The num patients in the trial were injected with either NVnumFGF or a placebo every two weeks for six weeks
THE BIG PICTURE San Diegos Vical does not have any products on the market and makes its revenue from licenses and royalty payments along with contracts and grants
NVnumFGF had advanced through earlier stages of testing but the failure means it may never be approved and Vical wont receive more revenue or royalties
SanofiAventis said it will evaluate all its options in developing the drug

But attention recognition and the chance to learn new skills are the key to keeping top performers on board as the job market improves experts say
More people are quitting their jobs voluntarily than getting laid off now
Human resources experts say employers can take several steps to keep employees from leaving even when a competitor offers a higher salary
Americans remain nervous about job stability while the stillrecovering economy means companies are largely not doling out lavish salary increases said Harry Osle a principal in consultancy Hackett Group Incs human resources practice
So whatll do the trick
Employees will be more hesitant to make a jump if they feel like theyre part of a family an organization thats investing in them Osle said
Make sure employees know what company goals are during the recovery from the recession said Sayed Sadjady who works on talent management for PricewaterhouseCoopers
New projects a quest to regain lost market share
Mentoring and coaching relationships are also crucial especially if mentors traveled a similar career path Sadjady said
Isolated employees can feel they have no prospects with the company
Employees need to learn new skills
Even if a promotion is not available challenge high potential workers with projects that will enable them to learn new skills and take on a new role said Tim Schoonover the chairman of career consulting firm OI Partners
Otherwise top performers will leave he said
People want to be appreciated
Give them attention Schoonover said
Flexible work schedules are also important said Sadjady

Grassroots Palestinian group puts conflict with Israel aside to learn about the Holocaust
Growing up in the West Bank Mujahid Sarsur knew next to nothing about the Holocaust and saw little ground to sympathize with a people he saw as his occupier
But thanks to an Israeli roommate overseas the numyearold Palestinian student learned about the Nazi murder of num million Jews during World War II and discovered a new understanding of his Israeli neighbors
Now he wants other Arabs to do the same
Sarsur heads one of a handful of Palestinian grassroots groups seeking knowledge about the Holocaust
On Wednesday he led a delegation of num students to Israels official Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem
The students fasting for Ramadan listened closely to their Arabicspeaking guides explanations and were left wideeyed by the gruesome images of the death camps
Girls in Muslim head scarves turned away in horror at the sight of Jewish corpses being shoveled into pits
They huddled together as they watched film from Auschwitz where about num million Jews were put to death
Arab sentiment toward the Holocaust ranges from ignorance about its details to outright denial
Some hold a more complex belief system acknowledging that the Holocaust did happen but that they are paying the price by the loss of their land with the creation of the state of Israel after World War II
After turbulent year following bankruptcy GM lays groundwork to sell stock to public again
Thirteen months ago General Motors was fighting for its life in bankruptcy court
Now the automaker is laying the groundwork to sell stock to the public once again with the eventual goal of ridding itself of government ownership
General Motors Co filed the first batch of paperwork required to hold an initial public offering of stock late Wednesday
The numpage document submitted to regulators laid out reasons and risks to investors considering buying GM stock
The filing called an Snum was short on specifics
GM didnt say how many shares would be sold or when although experts say the IPO could come as early as October
It also didnt say how many shares GMs majority owner the US government plans to unload
Such a sale would eventually lead to the government shrinking its big stake in the automaker something GM is eager to see
The companys outgoing CEO Ed Whitacre has said government ownership has hurt GMs public image and sales
However GM warned in its filing that the US Treasury would continue to own a substantial interest in the automaker following the IPO
More details about the offering is likely to emerge with additional filings in the coming weeks and months
GM did say its stakeholders initially will sell common stock while the company itself will sell preferred shares which are like bonds and include dividend payments
GM said it will use proceeds from the preferred stock sale for general business expenses
The filing means GM and its current owners are likely to sell part of their stakes in several offerings that will take months to finish said Scott Sweet owner of IPO research firm IPO Boutique
Analysts have speculated that the initial sale could be worth up to $num billion but the filing gave no number
GM would have to bring in $num billion just to pay back all the automakers stakeholders
That could come in several sales over months

Marylands highest court upheld a state law Friday that limits the amount of money people can receive for suffering in lawsuits
Judges on the Court of Appeals ruled against the parents of a numyearold boy who drowned at a Crofton swimming pool in num when they upheld the cap on certain payouts in a num opinion on that issue
Thomas Freed and Debbie NeagleFreed were awarded roughly $num million by a jury in a lawsuit filed after their sons death that alleged DRD Pool Service Inc had been negligent in maintaining the pool
But that payment was reduced to about $num million under Marylands limit on noneconomic damages in such cases
The Maryland state legislature first set the cap at $num roughly num years ago and lawmakers increased it to $num in num stipulating the cap should grow by $num every October
The cap is currently $num or $num in a wrongful death claim such as the Freeds case with two or more beneficiaries
The Freeds argued the cap was unconstitutional because it does not equally protect all people since individuals with more serious injuries are less likely to be able to keep entire lawsuit payouts than those with lessserious injuries whose damages dont exceed the cap
The court ruled however that there was a rational basis for the cap because it was meant to keep liability insurance affordable
In our view the Cap continues to serve a legitimate government purpose the opinion said
Attorney Steven Migdal who represented DRD Pool Service Inc in the suit praised the courts decision to uphold the cap saying the judges were right to maintain the longstanding and valid law
The way insurance companies set their rates is based on predictability Migdal said
When you have no cap the sky is the limit and it places insurance companies in a very difficult position
The court sided with the Freeds however on a separate issue in which they argued the original jury should have been allowed to consider awarding additional damages to compensate for their sons conscious pain and suffering without eyewitness testimony

University of Illinois Extension expects to announce budget cuts next week as it prepares for a possible $num million state budget reduction
The program which has about num employees in offices around the state is looking at closing or consolidating its num Extension centers to reduce rent and administrative costs spokesman Gary Beaumont said Tuesday
Officials hope to protect countylevel Extension offices as much as possible
The costcutting target is $num million as Gov
Pat Quinns budget plan for the fiscal year that starts July num trims Extension funding by about $num million Beaumont said
Legislators have yet to approve a budget however
All of this is educated guesswork Beaumont said
The state budget process has just started
Extension housed in the UI College of Agricultural Consumer and Environmental Sciences has been studying possible costsaving measures for several months
Meetings have been held around the state in recent weeks to gather public input on the options
The Extension centers including one in Champaign house employees who conduct educational programs across the state
They could end up working out of county offices instead or even from home but that hasnt been settled Beaumont said
Its likely all the centers would close though their leases expire at different times he said
The hope is that by reducing overhead expenses Extension can avoid cutting programs and people officials said
But Beaumont said If you do the math positions will be affected
He said county Extension directors may end up with responsibility for more than one county as a result of the cutbacks
Were trying to keep a local presence and a program in every county in the state Beaumont said
People like to have a local county presence
We heard that loud and clear in the public meetings
Were trying not to close any county offices
That all depends on the financing of the local program and thats different in every county he said
Several years ago many Illinois counties including Champaign approved ballot questions to financially support county Extension offices
Campus officials announced a budget review of Extension this week
They said Extension spends about $num million annually a mix of federal and state funding local tax income and other support from counties across the state as well as grants contracts and revolving funds
But that figure includes public service funding in the College of ACES that is not under Extensions control Beaumont said
The actual budget is closer to $num million he said
Extension offers a variety of programs including numH activities for children programs for farmers and workshops and classes on gardening consumer and family economics and other topics
Beaumont said Extension explores grant opportunities and has considered charging fees for its services but both of those options have limitations
You cant charge lowincome families for nutrition education for instance he said

Irelands government fighting for political survival as it drafts the most brutal budget in Irish history said Wednesday it will hold a byelection for a longempty parliamentary seat
a concession forced on it by an embarrassing court defeat
High Court Justice Nicholas Kearns ruled that the government had violated Irelands constitution by blocking a byelection in Donegal South West for num months
He said the unjustifiable delay offends the terms and spirit of the constitution and its framework for democracy
Opposition chiefs hoping to shoot down the December budget and force an early election cheered the judgment
Hours later Prime Minister Brian Cowen agreed to hold a byelection in the rural northwest constituency in the week of Nov num
less than two weeks before he will need every vote to pass a num budget expected to impose at least num billion $num billion in cuts and tax hikes
Cowen had hoped to delay any byelections
which his deeply unpopular government is virtually certain to lose
for several more months as Ireland enacts its deepest austerity moves yet to combat Europes worst deficit
The premier normally can count on support from num of the num current lawmakers one more than a bare majority but several supporters are reserving their positions on the budget vote until they see just how painful the cuts will be
Filling the Donegal South West seat with an opposition figure could mean Cowens coalition has to rely on a deciding vote from the parliaments usually neutral speaker
Losing the budget vote would trigger an early election
The national mood has been darkening in anticipation of cuts and tax hikes which would come on top of two years of such measures
As Cowen deflected questions inside parliament about the timing of elections an estimated num students marched to the gates outside in protest at fears that the December budget will drive up university fees
Many protesters wore Tshirts calling for Education not emigration
referring to a recent surge of young people leaving Irelands doubledigit unemployment for opportunities from Canada to Australia
While the main protest by the Union of Students in Ireland was peaceful hundreds jostled with riot police on foot and horseback afterward
Police and witnesses said students threw bricks placards and eggs at the Department of Finance and about num stormed into the lobby before being wrestled back out
Hundreds more staged a sitdown protest in the roadway
Police said several protesters were injured and several more arrested
The politician who sued the government over its Donegal byelection obstruction Pearse Doherty said Fianna Fail leaders had conspired to suspend democracy simply because theyre doing badly in the polls
Doherty whose Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party opposes the budget cuts is favored to win the Donegal South West seat
It has been vacant since June num when the incumbent a member of Cowens longruling Fianna Fail party left to take a seat in the European Parliament
On Tuesday Cowens parliamentary bloc suffered another casualty with the surprise resignation of Fianna Fail lawmaker Jim McDaid
His letter to Cowen accused the premier of preferring to cling to power than to make tough decisions and appealed for an election now
McDaids departure means the parliament now has four vacancies all likely to be filled by opposition candidates and demolishing Cowens majority
The seats in Dublin South and Waterford have gone unfilled since February and March respectively but Cowen still hopes to delay those byelections until April num
Cowens government has pleaded it cant run byelection campaigns at a time when it is trying to craft a fouryear plan for Irelands financial salvation
That plan is to be unveiled within two weeks followed by the num budget on Dec num
Ireland this year is expected to record the worst deficit in postwar European history num percent of GDP and has been ordered by European Union leaders to slash the deficit back to the eurozone limit of num percent by num
Uncertainty over Irelands capacity to keep paying its bills amid recession and a num billion $num billion bankbailout program has fueled a surge in the costs of Irish borrowing
The interest rates on Irish numyear bonds reached a new euroera high Wednesday of num percent nearly num percentage points above German bonds also a record spread dating back to the common currencys launch in num
Ireland has suspended new bond sales because of the punitively high rates
It plans to return to the market in early num and hopes by then investors will be reassured by the countrys deficitslashing efforts and demand less interest
A federal jury in Jonesboro has awarded $num million to a Walnut Ridge man who sued Ford Motor Co claiming that he was paralyzed in a car wreck because his seat belt was defective in his num Windstar van
Eric Polston was paralyzed from the waist down and in one arm after the num crash in which his van rolled over and Polston was ejected from the vehicle
Polston says he was wearing his seat belt and that a defect in the buckle caused it to release throwing him from the van
Jurors deliberating last week in Jonesboro agreed with Polston and awarded him $num million in damages
Ford argued that the vehicle was not defective and that the company wasnt liable for Polstons injuries

The Fulton County district attorney said Tuesday he expects criminal charges will be filed in the deaths of hundreds of pigs that perished at an abandoned southcentral Pennsylvania farm
District Attorney Travis Kendall declined to identify suspects in the case as the investigation continues
A person interested in buying the numacre farm discoved the dead pigs Nov num
A spokeswoman for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Tuesday there were between num and num carcasses conflicting with earlier estimates of more than num
The ASPCA said the pigs apparently were abandoned months ago
Most of the carcasses were found in a barn the group said
No live pigs were found
This is a tragic case and our hope at this point is that the submitted results will reveal exactly what happened to these animals and who should be held accountable Jeff Eyre an ASPCA official said
According to the Chambersburg Public Opinion the owners of the farm Daniel and Kerron Clark were separated some time ago
Attempts to find telephone listings for them were unsuccessful Tuesday
The property was recently put up for sale for $num million according to The Philadelphia Inquirer
It was listed on Oct num said Christina Lewellen spokeswoman for Virginiabased Long Foster Real Estate Inc
It was pulled off the market after the prospective buyer who inspected the property discovered the dead pigs
The realestate agent notified Kerron Clark that day and Clark notified authorities the next day the Public Opinion reported
State police Lt Gregory Bacher who is leading the investigation did not immediately return telephone calls Tuesday
The ASPCA one of several animalwelfare groups assisting state police in the investigation said potential evidence collected from the scene was submitted to the University of Pennsylvania for analysis
Emergency federal unemployment benefits could expire next month and the state is notifying thousands of jobless people who could be affected
Up to num million people across the country could lose emergency unemployment benefits during the holiday season unless Congress passes an extension
The payments average about $num a week nationwide
The state Employment Security Department says about num people in Washington could be affected
For the past year unemployed people could qualify for up to num weeks of jobless benefits
Its broken into three chunks num weeks of regular benefits num weeks of emergency benefits and another num weeks of extended benefits
The num weeks of emergency payments could be phased out if Congress doesnt act
This year the lawmakers have been grappling with health care reform financial regulation energy policy and a Supreme Court nomination
The next big rumble in Washington will most likely be the soontoexpire tax cuts enacted under the Bush administration in num and num
The sides already are entrenching
Republicans on the right seem to be staking out a position that all the tax cuts should be permanently extended calling it a tax increase if they are not
Apparently theyve never seen a tax cut they dont like or a spending program they do even if it reduces the deficit or benefits the middle class
There are Democrats on the left who say all the tax cuts should be allowed to expire by the end of the year and everyone should begin to pay their fair share
We dont believe this is an eitheror proposition
A sound economic policy calls for letting the tax cuts expire for the wealthiest Americans the top num percent to num percent in income while keeping or extending tax breaks for the middle class families making less than $num a year and small businesses where most jobs are created
This is unpleasant but necessary fiscal discipline
Eliminating the tax cuts for the wealthiest would reduce the federal budget deficit by as much as $num trillion at a time when more and more people are becoming concerned about the $num trillion national debt
Restoring the top income tax rates to num percent and num percent from the current num percent and num percent would simply roll back the top rates to prenum levels
Thats where they should have remained considering the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which the country has been borrowing to pay for in the past nine years
Some have argued it was OK to borrow money to pay for the wars which have cost more than $num trillion and counting
But we believe it is unfair to continue to put this tremendous burden on our children and grandchildren
These are our wars and those currently with the most money and enjoying the most monetary fruits from our society should help pay for them
There are those who say letting the tax cuts expire for the wealthiest will hurt the economy but we agree with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that letting the tax breaks for the high earners expire will not hurt economic growth
Recent studies indicate wealthier Americans arent spending the money they could to boost the economy in the worst recession since the Great Depression
Also in the political battles this fall will be the tax on estates larger than $num million tax rates on dividends and capital gains the alternative minimum tax and the child tax credit
Congress will have to consider these very carefully
Those that benefit the middle class and num percent of Americans should be extended as people struggle to make ends meet in this economy
The Treasury is supporting tax cuts and lending measures that would help small businesses grow which is where the focus should be
Fridays July num Courier News of Bridgewater and Home News Tribune of East Brunswick on the resurgence of minor league baseball in New Jersey
Baseball fans of a certain generation recall fondly the time New Jersey had some of the most formidable minor league teams
The Newark Bears a New York Yankees farm team and the Jersey City Giants were in the International League and these teams were probably better than some of the bottom feeders in Major League Baseball
But by the num season they were moved elsewhere at a time when baseball games involving the Yankees Dodgers and Giants were available almost every night on television
Apart from temporary stops by minor league teams at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City professional baseball was absent in New Jersey until num when minor league teams were placed in Trenton and in Augusta in Sussex County
Who knew baseball at this level could be so popular in New Jersey
There are now three minor league teams affiliated with big league franchises including the Lakewood BlueClaws and the Trenton Thunder
There are four unaffiliated independent teams including the Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater
It does not matter that few players on these teams have familiar names
In New Jersey you have teams that do very well not so much because they put the best players on the field but because theyre very very good at marketing said Marvin Goldklang of Livingston who owns four minor league teams
Steve Kalafer owner of the Somerset Patriots has said he will never compete with the Yankees for the fans dollars
He explained that the Yankees are Broadway and to be sure they charge Broadway prices
The Patriots are something like a regional offBroadway theater providing an accessible affordable night out
Going to these games does not involve crossing the George Washington Bridge or navigating the BrooklynQueens Expressway
The seven ballparks allow fans close proximity to the field in stadiums about onesixth the size of a major league park
According to some fans who have been to countless ballparks in America Campbells Field in Camden has the most stunning vista of them all with the Ben Franklin Bridge and skyline of Philadelphia looming over the outfield wall
The story of the revival of professional baseball in New Jersey has not been all good
A franchise in Atlantic City failed and one in downtown Newark has been struggling
However taken together the professional teams have been a plus for the sporting culture in New Jersey drawing num million fans in the num season
Thursdays July num Asbury Park Press on restrictions for younger New Jersey drivers
So far one thing seems clear about Kyleighs Law Its not universally popular among teenagers or their parents
The law involves changes that were made to whats known as the graduated or provisional drivers license for motorists under num who are new to the roads
One requirement of the law mandates that teen drivers display red decals on their cars that identify them as provisional drivers
Some parents have voiced concern the decals could identify teens to predators trolling the roads for victims
Earlier this week a state Senate panel sent two bills to the full Senate calling for a study of Kyleighs Law
In addition four other bills have been introduced that call for repealing the decal requirement altogether
Some of the members of the Senate Transportation Committee say these bills could advance before the state Attorney Generals Office is able to complete a sixmonth study of Kyleighs Law and send a report to the Legislature on its effectiveness
It would be a mistake to act on the other bills before the study is completed
The reasoning behind Kyleighs Law
named for a numyearold Morris County student who was killed in num while riding in a car driven by a teenager with a provisional license
The decals are intended to expose teen drivers to greater scrutiny by law enforcement
Some teens say this unfairly stigmatizes them
The fact is teen drivers are less experienced than most other motorists and they need to be more closely watched by police
If that causes a few ruffled feathers so be it
Its preferable to having teen drivers riding around with too many passengers in the car being out past their curfew or committing some other violation
The decals remind police to be alert for these things
And they remind teens that they may be subject to closer police scrutiny
The concern voiced by parents about predators is worth analyzing
But we question how likely a scenario it is for teens to be targeted while theyre on the roads in a moving vehicle
We suspect that fear is largely groundless
In any case teens should be taught
never to pull over for someone they do not know to keep their car doors locked at all times and to keep a cell phone with them in case they need to call num in an emergency
There are better ways of counteracting any threat posed by predators than scrapping a law that could do a considerable amount of good
The decal provision of Kyleighs Law should not be thrown out before the Attorney Generals Office has a chance to complete its study and the Legislature has a chance to digest it

A project has found that some edible garden plants have a chemical in them from tainted wells in North Pole
The Department of Health and Social Services says sulfolane was found in only two types of plants
and was in low levels not considered a health risk
Six types of plants were tested from four North Pole gardens and the chemical was found in the leaves of lettuce and rhubard but not the roots stems fruits or flowers
Sulfolane is an industrial solvent found in wells last fall near the Flint Hills refinery
The chemical tends to concentrate in plants where the water evaporation occurs which typically is in the leaves
Slowergrowing plants will be tested at the end of the growing season
Anger against the government runs deep in north Georgia where two Republicans candidates are trying to outconservative each other in advance of Tuesdays runoff for a vacated congressional seat
No matter where they go candidates Tom Graves and Lee Hawkins are met with voters angry with just about everything coming out of Washington President Barack Obamas health care overhaul taxes the influence of organized labor a deadlock on immigration policy even the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
On a recent day Graves num was cornered at a coffee shop event by Jenny Serwitz a numyearold mother who saw her real estate business dry up during the recession
You guys are both conservative Republicans
Im so furious with whats going on
Stung by the force of her words Graves rocked back in his cowboy boots and nodded his head before pulling out his ace
Hes the candidate with tea party backing
Thats enough for me Serwitz said
In the race to win this conservative district there are few policy differences between the candidates
In some respects its style that separates the two
Hawkins says hes a member of the National Rifle Association
Meanwhile Graves distributes a campaign flier showing him and his son with a shotgun
On the issue of the $num billion federal stimulus package Hawkins says he would have preferred to use tax cuts instead of government spending
Graves denounces the legislation as a failed economic policy
Hawkins num has said he shares tea party concerns over government spending
Graves has been involved with the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots since early num and touts the groups backing even though they are outside the congressional district
In the May num special election to replace Nathan Deal Graves won num percent of the vote compared to num percent for Hawkins in a field with eight candidates
Since no candidate earned num percent of the vote plus one a runoff was set for Tuesday
The winner will be in office mere weeks before facing a July num primary for the full twoyear term
The numth congressional district is heavily Republican and covers num counties in north Georgia
In the num presidential race num percent of voters there cast a ballot for Republican John McCain
Graves and Hawkins bring different constituencies to the election
Graves a real estate developer who lives in rural Ranger was elected to Georgias House of Representatives in num
He has earned endorsements and financial backing from the antitax Club For Growth and FreedomWorks former House Majority Leader Dick Armeys organization that works closely with tea party supporters
Hawkins a dentist represented the Gainesville area in the Georgia Senate and has touted his reputation as a problemsolver
In government philosophy is good
You need values Hawkins said
But at the end of the day you need a workable plan
Recently Hawkins hit the campaign trail telling voters he is the local alternative and criticizing Graves for receiving support from outside groups
He knocked on doors in a wellheeled Hall County suburb and passed out fliers disputing a mailer from the Club For Growth over health care
The group has spent more than $num to support Graves campaign in addition to bundling donations to him from as far away as California Tennessee Minnesota and Rhode Island
Hawkins knew several residents in the neighborhood because they were patients at his familys dental practice
He repeatedly asked them to call num friends to spread word of his candidacy
I dont have the money to keep up with them Hawkins told one woman referring to Graves and the Club For Growth
Ive been raising money in north Georgia so I dont have the big Washington bucks

A resurgence of bedbugs across the US has homeowners and apartment dwellers taking desperate measures to eradicate the tenacious bloodsuckers with some relying on dangerous outdoor pesticides and flybynight exterminators
The problem has gotten so bad that the Environmental Protection Agency warned this month against the indoor use of chemicals meant for the outside
The agency also warned of an increase in pest control companies and others making unrealistic promises of effectiveness or low cost
Bedbugs infesting US households on a scale unseen in more than a halfcentury have become largely resistant to common pesticides
As a result some homeowners and exterminators are turning to more hazardous chemicals that can harm the central nervous system irritate the skin and eyes or even cause cancer
Ohio authorities struggling against widespread infestations in Cincinnati Columbus Dayton and other cities are pleading with EPA to approve the indoor use of the pesticide propoxur which the agency considers a probable carcinogen and banned for inhome use in num
About num other states are supporting Ohios request for an emergency exemption
The EPA rejected the request in June but said it would consider new information on it
An agency spokesman Dale Kemery said the EPA has pledged to find new potent chemicals to kill bedbugs which can cause itchy red bites that can become infected if scratched
In the meantime authorities around the country have blamed house fires on people misusing all sorts of highly flammable garden and lawn chemicals to fight bedbugs
Experts also warn that some hardware products
bug bombs cedar oil and other natural oils
claim to be lethal but merely cause the bugs to scatter out of sight and hide in cracks in walls and floors
A pest control company in Newark NJ was accused in July of applying chemicals not approved for indoor use throughout num homes and apartments units even spraying mattresses and childrens toys
In Cincinnati an unlicensed applicator saturated an apartment complex in June with an agricultural pesticide typically used on golf courses
Seven tenants got sick and were treated at the hospital
The property was quarantined and all tenants were forced to move
Authorities are pursuing criminal charges
When you see the anguish that bedbugs cause these people its understandable why they might take things into their own hands and some of it is very dangerous said Michael Potter an entomologist at the University of Kentucky and one of the countrys leading bedbug experts
Bedbugs a common household pest for centuries all but vanished in the nums and nums with the widespread use of DDT
But DDT was banned in num as too toxic to wildlife especially birds
Since then the bugs have developed resistance to chemicals that replaced DDT
Also exterminators have fewer weapons in their arsenal than they did just a few years ago because of a num Clintonera law that requires older pesticides to be reevaluated based on more stringent health standards
The reevaluations led to the restrictions on propoxur and other pesticides
Though propoxur is still used in pet collars it is banned for use in homes because of the risk of nausea dizziness and blurred vision in children
Steven Bradbury director of the EPAs pesticide program said the problem is that children crawl on the floor and put their fingers in their mouths
Critics in the pest control industry say that the federal government is overreacting and that professional applicators can work with families to prevent children from being exposed to harmful levels of the chemical which is more commonly used outside against roaches and crickets
Its a knockout pesticide vastly superior to anything else for bedbugs said Andrew Christman president of Ohio Exterminating Co which is on pace to treat about num bedbug infestations in num up from an average of two in num
Christman said other inhome pesticides arent as lethal as propoxur requiring several treatments that can push extermination costs to $num or $num depending on the size of a home
Marion Ehrich a toxicologist at the VirginiaMaryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine said the EPA is showing appropriate caution
She said other scientists who have studied the bedbug problem are not eager to see propoxur released in homes
Propoxur is not a silver bullet and given time bedbugs would likely become resistant to it too said Lyn Garling an entomologist at Penn State University
Experts say it is going to take a comprehensive public health campaign
publicservice announcements travel tips and perhaps even taxpayerfunded extermination programs for public housing
to reduce the bedbug problem
People can get bedbugs by visiting infested homes or hotels where the vermin hide in mattresses pillows and curtains
The bugs are stealth hitchhikers that climb onto bags clothing and luggage
After the bugs were discovered this summer in a Times Square movie theater and some upscale clothing stores New York City began a $num public awareness campaign
Last week the pest control company Terminix listed New York Philadelphia and Detroit as the three mostinfested cities based on call volume to its num service centers
Ohio had three cities in the top num
For Delores Stewart num bedbugs have been a nightmare infesting her Columbus home since last year
Its awful its disheartening and its a terrible way to live Stewart num a retired meat factory worker who discovered the vermin crawling in her bed and her living room recliners
Her house was treated by a reputable exterminator for the fourth time Wednesday
She has warned neighbors and others about the problem and doesnt blame them for staying away
I feel isolated she said
Darrell Spegal a property manager in Columbus who oversees four apartment complexes said he has spent thousands of dollars to exterminate units
We have to try something different Spegal said
The bugs are winning this war

Divisions within the Federal Reserve over how to pump up the US economy and lower unemployment came into sharper view Wednesday
Three Fed officials squared off in competing speeches over how much help would come from one likely next step
Narayana Kocherlakota president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis argued that such an effort may not help the economy much
Charles Plosser president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia made a similar point
But Eric Rosengren president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said Fed policymakers must do what they can to bring some more relief
The Fed delivered a strong signal last week at its meeting that it was prepared to act if the economy weakened
High on the list of unconventional tools is buying more government debt known as quantitative easing
The goal is to force down rates on consumer and businesses loans even more to get Americans to boost their spending
Doing so would help the economy
In their speeches Kocherlakota and Plosser expressed skepticism that quantitative easing would drive down rates nearly as much as such efforts did during the recession and financial crisis
Because financial markets are in better shape now than during the crisis the difference between the rates on supersafe Treasury securities and rates on other consumer and business loans has narrowed
I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them Kocherlakota said
A new debtbuying program would have a more muted effect he concluded
Plosser said Monetary policy is not a magic elixir that can solve every economic ill
However Rosengren said buying more government debt could benefit the economy and therefore should be considered
It is important that policymakers be open to implementing policies that are aimed at lowering unemployment and preventing inflation from getting too low which could put the country at risk of deflation he said in a speech in New York
Many economists believe the Fed is likely to announce action when it wraps up a twoday meeting on Nov num the day after the congressional midterm elections
Although the Fed has yet to coalesce around a specific plan one idea put forward by James Bullard president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis is gaining closer scrutiny
Under Bullards approach the Fed would initially buy a moderate amount of government bonds
perhaps in the range of $num billion or less
After that the Fed would review the economic climate at each meeting and decide whether it needs to buy more government bonds to bolster the recovery
That would allow the Fed to avoid making the kind of upfront commitment to buy government debt on a large scale in the trilliondollar range
It also could ease concerns among some Fed officials about carrying out the type of largescale interventions seen during the recession
The Fed ended up buying a total of roughly $num trillion of mortgage securities and debt as well as government bonds during the recession
Another big buying binge would complicate the Feds efforts later on to unwind all its stimulus
There are also concerns that another largescale effort could spark inflation later on or trigger a wave of speculative buying that could create bubbles in the prices of bonds or commodities or other assets
On Wednesday the three Fed presidents in their speeches weighed the pros and cons of buying government debt in general rather than the specific Bullard proposal
Rosengren is currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee
the group including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that makes decisions on interest rates and other policies that influence economic activity
Kocherlakota and Plosser will both be voting members next year although they participate in the Fed meetings and debates over policy moves
Kocherlakota spoke in London while Plosser spoke in New Jersey

A subcity of underwater robots is busily working num feet num meters below the surface to help contain the leak that has gushed millions of gallons liters of oil into the water since the Deepwater Horizon blew up April num killing num workers
Anyone who has watched online video of the crude spewing from the seafloor has seen their work
the cameras that provide the feeds are attached to the robots as they maneuver around the spill site
They also made news this week when one bumped into a cap that has been collecting some of the oil forcing BP to remove it for about num hours and leaving the flow into the Gulf unchecked
But theres been only one other problem in two months despite the robots busy task
They are very active and they are playing a very vital role in everything we do BP spokesman Mark Salt said
People cant be down there
Pilots operate the robots from comfortablelooking LaZBoytype chairs
On the left armrest of each is a joystick that moves the robots mechanical arm
On the right is the joystick that maneuvers the machine through the water
In front of the pilot are num monitors DVD video recorders and a sonar screen
Its the most fun job in the world said Jeffrey Harris of Oceaneering International Inc which is providing about num robots to work on the Gulf spill
The joysticks resemble the ones used in fighter jets and he joked theyre a little more sophisticated than your Gameboy
The most popular remotely operated vehicle
being used in the project is the Millennium an numfoot nummeterlong numpound numkilogram rectangular foamtopped device with humanlike arms that has the added benefit of wrists that can rotate continuously like a drill
Its like a construction worker Harris said
But its got a lot more whistles and bells than a construction worker
The devices using fiber optic technology are what allow the oil industry to drill and remove oil and natural gas from thousands of feet under the water
While a human cannot work in underwater pressures of more than num feet num meters these robots have been able to operate in depths of up to num feet num meters
and for unlimited time as long as parts dont fail
Robots have been part of offshore drilling since the nums said Andrew Bowen director of the National Deep Submergence Facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
The technology was first developed by the US Department of Defense to examine downed Soviet submarines
Since then the technology has advanced greatly with the ROVs moving from relatively simple basketballshaped devices to the massive boxes of today
But in num years in the industry Bowen said hes never seen them used quite like this
Theyre helping to hook up fluid connectors hoses and plumbing install newly developed oil recovery systems and build the relief wells that are considered the best hope of stopping the gusher
Bowen and other scientists also have submersibles monitoring oil flow gathering data on the ecosystem and sea life and surveying the underwater plume of dispersed oil
The challenge now is getting the robots to perform new tasks in real time without the benefit of prior testing or tweaking
Said Bowen It is going to require a range of new techniques and technologies developed and tested and put into service so we are far better prepared to respond in the case heaven forbid where we are confronted again with a situation like this
Wyoming state employees could become eligible for meritbased bonuses for the first time in at least num years
Dave Freudenthals num supplemental budget calls for $num million for bonuses of up to $num for state employees
Freudenthals budget proposal also seeks $num million for raises for num of the estimated num fulltime and num parttime employees
If approved by lawmakers next session the proposal would need the approval of incoming Gov
The Casper StarTribune reports state employees who meet or exceed their supervisors expectations would receive $num while those who meet expectations would receive $num
Those deemed by their supervisors to need improvement wont get a bonus
State human resources Administrator Dean Fausset estimates that only num percent of state employees get needs improvement ratings
Last month the mayor of Cheyenne abandoned a proposal to give city employees $num bonuses saying it sends the wrong message as voters were being asked to renew a fifth penny sales tax
Mike McVay director of the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information said its the first time in his num years that hes seen such a proposal move forward
Weve never really had a mechanism to do that since Ive been here McVay said
About the only way someone can realize the fruits of their labor is they get promoted but there arent always avenues of promotion available to everybody
Bonuses under Freudenthals budget proposal would be onetime payments rather than an ongoing program
McVay said meritbased bonuses would be the last step in a multiyear process to improve state employee compensation and rework employee classification

Senate Republicans derailed legislation Saturday to extend expiring tax cuts at all but the highest income levels in a political showdown that paradoxically clears a path for a compromise with the White House on steps to boost the economy
We need to get this resolved and Im confident we can do it President Barack Obama said shortly after the near partyline votes
The public must have the peace of mind that their taxes will not go up on Jan num he added
Obama has signaled that he will bow to Republican demands for extending tax cuts at all income levels and his remarks capped a day that lurched between political conflict and talk of compromise on an issue that played a leading role in last months elections
Democrats introduced two measures in the Senate to extend the tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans in an effort to showcase Republican lawmakers as defenders of millionaires and gain an edge for the num elections
Republicans dismissed the Democrats maneuvers as the last gasp of a party that lost its majority in the House of Representatives in the Nov num elections surrendered several seats in the Senate and will be forced to share power beginning in January
Republicans noted that unemployment rose to num percent last month and said it made no sense to raise taxes on anyone in a weak economy
It is the most astounding theory I have ever seen
Raise taxes to create jobs said Sen John Thune of South Dakota
But Democrats accused Republicans of contributing to rising deficits while siding with the rich by rejecting proposals that would let tax cuts passed during George W Bushs presidency lapse on sevenfigure incomes
Do we want to extend those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires at a time of huge deficits
I would argue vociferously we shouldnt said Sen Charles Schumer of New York
But the rhetoric subsided quickly after the votes and Senate leaders in both parties said they hoped political clashes would give way to compromise in the next several days
Obama later spoke with Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
A White House official said the president told them he was open to a temporary extension of the tax cuts if the Democratic priorities were included in the deal
Sen Mitch McConnell the Republican leader said he was relatively confident there would be a deal with the White House not to raise taxes in the middle of a recession
He said talks were continuing on the length of an extension to be enacted for the cuts that were put in place in num and num
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he hoped for an agreement by the middle or end of next week on legislation that would combine an extension of tax cuts with a renewal of expiring jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed
Officials have said that in addition to tax cuts and unemployment benefits the White House wants to include renewal of several other tax provisions that are expiring
They include a break for lower and middle class wage earners even if they dont make enough to pay taxes to the government as well as for college students and for companies that hire the unemployed
Key lawmakers and administration officials have been at work negotiating the terms of a possible deal for several days
But many congressional Democrats privately have expressed anger at Obama for his willingness to surrender to Republican demands to let the tax cuts remain in place at upper incomes and numerous officials said no compromise would be possible until they had engineered votes in both the House and Senate
Any deal would mean a reversal for Obama who said in the num presidential race and this year that he wanted to let cuts expire above incomes of $num for individuals and $num for couples
In the Senate a bill to enact Obamas original position was blocked on a vote of num seven votes short of the num needed to advance the legislation over Republican delaying maneuvers
Republicans were unanimous in their opposition and were joined by five members of the Democratic caucus
The second measure would have kept the tax cuts in place on incomes below $num million
It appeared crafted to appeal to senators from states with large highincome populations as well as cast Republicans as protectors of the rich
It was blocked on a vote of num also seven short of the num needed
A slightly different lineup of Democrats sided with Republicans on this measure
The White House also opposed the second measure and given the presidents willingness to sign a bill to extend all the expiring tax cuts there was never any doubt about the outcome of the days proceedings in the Senate
The days events capped a week that included a meeting at the White House at which Obama and top congressional Republicans sat down together for the first time since the elections
Both the president and Republican lawmakers pledged afterward they would try to work together for the good of the economy and agreed to set up a small negotiating group to discuss the tax issues
The White House Reid and Republicans have been negotiating quietly and McConnell made a point of saying he had been in frequent touch with the administration in recent days
In addition to tax cuts Obama has made ratification of a new nuclear arms control treaty with Russia a priority of the postelection session of Congress reducing his leverage with Republicans in the struggle over taxes
Senior Senate Republicans have indicated they will not try to interfere with a debate on the New START treaty as long as government spending and tax cut issues have been resolved to their satisfaction
A twothirds majority is required for ratification of the treaty meaning the White House will need the support of at least nine Republicans to prevail
Vice President Joseph Biden and other officials have been involved in talks with several Republican senators in hopes of lining up the votes needed

Brickley also opposes a possible compromise on a lease if the compromise involves the railroad continuing to control the land
This year will be Ice Alaskas last year unless the Legislature takes action Brickley said
We are asking for the ground he said
Ice Alaskas problems arose a few years ago when the railroad increased its rent
By state law the railroad must get fair market value for its properties

We believe a copromote would have provided nearterm value but the story would basically become a royalty and copromote investment rather than significantly more interesting upside through developing a potential blockbuster new schizophrenia drug with good proofofconcept data

Across the South Blue Dog Democrats up for reelection find themselves in difficult races caught between their partys leadership in Washington and angry voters back home sympathetic to Republicans
The difficulties for Democrats are apparent across the region from Georgia and North Carolina to Alabama and Mississippi
Of the num Blue Dog lawmakers in the South on the ballot a dozen races are competitive
Three additional caucus members have decided to retire and one is running for the Senate triggering open races for those seats
If members of the fiscally and socially conservative Blue Dog coalition lose the partys center could shift more to the left making it harder to win races in the conservative South
The worst thing that could ever happen is to get rid of a moderate and put someone in thats an extreme to one side said Rep Heath Shuler of North Carolina who has broken from his partys leadership in the current Congress more often than any other lawmaker in his states delegation
Our country doesnt need that
In North Carolina Shuler and fellow Democratic Rep Mike McIntyre have struggled to shake ads accusing them of following the agenda of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
And yet both voted against the Democratic health care overhaul and the num financial system bailout
McIntyre also voted against a capandtrade energy proposal while Shuler voted against President Barack Obamas $num billion stimulus package
It appears they will continue pushing their party toward the center While Pelosi and Obama have proposed letting taxes rise on the highestearning Americans the moderate Democrats each want the tax breaks to be extended at least another two years
Shuler elected to Congress just four years ago has said he would even consider running against Pelosi for speaker
Shuler said Pelosis policies dont reflect his western North Carolina district
The moderates are whats going to change things that have been going on in Washington he said
Pelosi herself is a hotbutton issue in middle Georgia where Rep Jim Marshall is running in a close race with Republican state Rep Austin Scott
Marshall previously supported Pelosi for House speaker but he announced during this campaign that he would oppose her staying on as their leader
Hes made Pelosi a central figure in TV ads running throughout middle Georgia
One commercial opens with hippies dropping flower petals to the strains of a sitar then cuts into Marshall meeting on a Southern street corner with a cleancut uniformed veteran
Georgia is a long way from San Francisco a man says in a Southern drawl
And Jim Marshall is a long way from Nancy Pelosi
Hes irked Democrats by voting against Obamas health care overhaul and against a capandtrade proposal while supporting the extension of Bushera tax cuts
Hes also irritated Republicans by supporting a $num billion fiscal stimulus package
I lose votes on both sides of those who are wed to leadership wed to the vision of either Democratic leadership or Republican leadership Marshall said
What I try to do is figure out whats the best thing to do for my district and country with each one of these issues
Scott blames Marshall for allowing Democrats to run up the budget deficit and generally expand the reach of government
He doubts Marshall would staunchly oppose Pelosi for another term as House speaker and Scott said he believes the Democratic incumbent will lose plum committee assignments for publicly opposing her
I think hes put himself in a position where he cant help anybody Scott said

The fields and long red barns at the University of Vermont will soon house fewer cows as low milk prices high costs and budget cuts have forced the university to sell its herd
Other universities are doing the same or looking for other ways to cut costs as high feed fuel and labor prices make it difficult to keep animals during tight economic times
The sales are taking place despite growing enrollment in agriculture programs
The herds are mainly used for faculty research
The University of Vermont plans to sell its num Holsteins and have faculty do their work on private farms that could be paid $num a year for three years said Tom Vogelmann dean of UVMs College of Agriculture and Life Sciences
The farmers would benefit from the added income while researchers would have access to more cows possibly in more modern facilities
Were really excited because we feel that this is really a new model that landgrant institutions can work toward Vogelmann said
Most landgrant universities face similar challenges he said as the cost of keeping animals increases faster than the price of milk or state funding
A minority of schools are discontinuing their herds but all institutions are looking at the costs of keeping their animals said Jim Linn vice president of the American Dairy Science Association
It is a major cost and we try and offset some of those costs through research and teaching dollars but again its more costly than plant sciences said Linn who is department head for animal science at the University of Minnesota which like Michigan State University is selling one of three herds
Cows also will go on the auction block at the University of Kentucky which hopes to reduce its herd from about num animals to about num by September
Along with being squeezed by low milk prices and costly upkeep the school has run out of room to spread manure as other agriculture programs expand said Nancy Cox director of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station and associate dean for College of Agriculture
Kentucky had hoped to move its herd to a new facility at Eastern Kentucky University about num minutes away but money isnt available right now to build it Cox said
We are losing money she said
While the universities arent into dairying to make money many sell their milk to try to recoup some of their costs
Certainly the economy thats affected dairy farming in general has affected us and its not sustainable Cox said
On top of that states have been reducing funding for landgrant universities for about num years or longer said Paul Hassen a spokesman for the Association of Public and Landgrant Universities
That has only accelerated with the budget problems in many states
Rutgers University opted to combine its herd with one at the University of Delaware about two hours away about eight years ago
We were facing the same sorts of difficulties and compounded with that was our dairy herd was housed in an old barn that was not the latest technology for teaching dairy science and so what we had was an expensive operation that wasnt even a good model of what the numst century dairying is all about said Larry S Katz director of Rutgers Cooperative Extension
Rutgers moved its cows to Delawares more modern dairy facility and it now raises their offspring the young females called heifers
Rutgers has focused its research on heifers behavior bedding and nutrition
When the animals have grown enough to be ready to produce calves they move to Delaware which specializes in dairy production research
Its worked out fantastic Katz said
In the old barn we had about num cows that we were milking and the various heifers of different ages
We now at times weve had as many as num animals on our campus for the students to work with
Another plus is that Rutgers is nearly breaking even with its costs he said
UVM sees the sale of its herd and shift from centralized research as an opportunity to do more research not less Vogelmann said
The savings from not maintaining the herd
will go into research possibly on forage animal nutrition environmental effects and heifer and calf rearing
While the school will keep num cows at its farm for research and its handson Cooperative for Real Education in Agricultural Management program faculty will have access to many more
Before we were sort of limited to num animals for research trials Vogelmann said
But if you look at an hours driving radius around here that number is multiplied tenfold
A numyearold bank robbery suspect in Connecticut says he was tricked into giving a teller a note demanding money

Honor Roll for mortality rates by Gannettpoint site
Hospital Mortality Rates Have Improved More Than num Percent Since num
ALBANY UNDERSCORE Statewide mortality rates have improved by an average of more than
num percent and the number of hospitals doing procedures below the recommended
volume has decreased num percent since num according to the Niagara Health
Quality Coalitions num Hospital Report Card
Hospitals showed improvement in eight out of num measures of hospital error
rates measured by the nonprofit coalition such as surgical opening of the
skull and hip replacement the coalition found
infection rates have not gotten better
Variations among and within hospitals
are too high for most types of care said the report which was released Sunday
Measures improve for a lot of reasons but one reason is because senior
hospital staffs and clinical staffs have the information to actually improve
care Bruce Boissonnault president and CEO of the Niagara Health
The Hospital Report Card based on patients admitted to hospitals in num
measured whether hospitals did fewer complex procedures than the thresholds
At institutions where too few are
performed the prognosis for patients is not as high it said
The report card available in English and Spanish at wwwmyhealthfindercom
includes new measures of quality this year including potentially preventable
readmissions effective communications between patients and their doctors and nurses and cleanliness
Data for readmission rates are from num
Patients can measure quality by seeing where they have the best chance of
surviving but they can also look at where patients say they are most satisfied
or which hospitals do a better job at managing patients pain and other patient
The report on potentially preventable readmissions is a milestone
It is the first time hospitals can see how well their care is
coordinated with the communities they release patients into and can work to make
sure they dont release patients and then readmit them two five or num days
Readmissions could be prompted by poor care upon initial admission to a
hospital andor a poor handoff between the hospital and the primary care
system said Dr Norbert Goldfield a riskadjustment and qualitymeasurement
expert involved in the research analysis
The coalition is an independent organization that is not affiliated with any
A lot of the funding for performance reports is
being directed to groups that are dominated by providers that are being graded he said
Randy Wolken president of the Manufacturers Association of Central New
York said the report card allows manufacturers and businesses to be informed
about where to find quality health care in New York
We find this report an incredibly accurate and important way to talk about
health care said Wolken whose group represents num companies in num counties
The Coalitions report is one of more than a dozen tools hospitals can use to
gauge areas that need attention said William Van Slyke a spokesman for the
Healthcare Association of New York State
The concept of quality reporting is a
key factor in hospitals success he said
The goal is zero errors and providers have been serious in trying to achieve
Its a continual improvement process
it never can end he said
The state Health Department provides data on its website wwwnyhealthgov
The states hospital report cards measure quality of care
for heart conditions pneumonia treatment and other areas surgical infection
prevention and performance on a variety of procedures
The data used is from
July num through June num
Other findings from the Health Quality Coalition Report Card include
A number of hospitals in New York City and on Long Island received subpar pain management effectiveness scores
Fiftyseven percent of patients rated their hospital either a nine or a

The European Unions highest court rejected a challenge Tuesday by four British cell phone companies to a Europewide price cap on fees for using a phone abroad
The British branches of Vodafone Telefonica Onum TMobile and Orange had argued against the EUs imposing maximum price limits for roaming charges or extra fees for making or receiving calls outside the users home nation
The European Court of Justice dismissed their arguments saying the EUs executive commission did not abuse its powers when it fixed limits for roaming fees across the numnation bloc in num
Europeans have long complained about high roaming fees they were being charged
That high level of retail charges had been regarded as a persistent problem by public authorities and consumer protection associations the court said in a statement
It said the average level of roaming charges in the European Union was euronum $num per minute more than five times the actual cost that telecommunications companies paid to transfer the calls to each other
The court also backed the maximum price set by EU regulators saying they had carefully examined the economic impact
EU moves to curb roaming charges have reduced European travelers cell phone bills by about num percent to euronum $num a month according to EU data
A fourminute call from Cyprus to Belgium used to cost more than euronum
Beginning July num the EU roaming law will decrease charges again setting a maximum price of euronum $num per minute for making a mobile phone call when abroad and euronum $num for receiving one plus valueadded tax
The European Commission has also set caps on prices for sending text messages and using mobile Internet
Also beginning July num customers will have to set a limit on how much they want to pay for using mobile Internet abroad
or be set a default of euronum $num
They will get a warning when they come close to that limit and will be cut off when they go beyond it to prevent them racking up massive fees

This year though residents of several states will have to wait up to five months to receive their state tax refunds because of budget shortfalls
The federal government hasnt run out of money at least not yet
Still at a time when many people need their refund checks to pay the bills some taxpayers federal tax refunds have been delayed
Taxpayers who file their federal tax return electronically and arrange for direct deposit typically receive their refunds in about two weeks the IRS says
But here are some reasons your federal tax refund could arrive later than expected
You failed to claim the Making Work Pay credit
Of the num million individual tax returns filed by early March more than num million contained an error related to this credit the IRS says
Last years economic stimulus package provided most taxpayers with a tax credit of $num or $num for married couples
The IRS adjusted its withholding tables so the credit was spread out through the year
But when you file your tax return you need to claim the credit on Schedule M says Michelle Eldridge a spokeswoman for the IRS tax software programs will do this automatically
This is particularly important for taxpayers such as workers who are selfemployed who didnt receive the credit through withholding or only received a partial credit
The IRS will recalculate the credit for taxpayers who fail to claim it which could result in a larger refund Eldridge says
But it could also delay your refund by two to three weeks she says
You received a Making Work Pay credit and an Economic Recovery Payment
As part of the stimulus package Social Security beneficiaries received a onetime Economic Recovery Payment of $num
However beneficiaries who had earned income last year may have also received the Making Work Pay credit
Since the maximum a taxpayer can receive from both programs is $num those seniors will have to reduce their Making Work Pay credit by the amount of their Economic Recovery Payment
Failure to do this could hold up your refund
If youre not sure whether you received the $num payment youll have to check your bank records
The IRS didnt send out a notice about the payment and neither did the Social Security Administration
The Treasury Department delivered the checks last year in the same manner Social Security beneficiaries received their regular benefits
If you received your Social Security benefits through direct deposit last year your check went directly into your bank account
You claimed the home buyers credit
Taxpayers who were firsttime home buyers in num are eligible for a tax credit of up to $num while repeat buyers are eligible for a credit of up to $num
Thats a nice benefit but you may have to postpone buying those window treatments
Taxpayers who claim this credit are required to attach a copy of their settlement statement to their tax return
That means they must file their return by mail instead of electronically
Congress added this requirement last year in response to reports of widespread fraud in connection with the credit
Taxpayers who file their returns on paper typically have to wait four to six weeks to get their refunds
In addition the IRS didnt start processing returns that claimed the home buyers credit until midFebruary says Bob Meighan vice president of TurboTax
As a result even taxpayers who filed their returns in January and claimed the credit may not get their refunds until early April he says
If youre frustrated by refund delays theres an easy way to avoid this angst adjust your withholding
You can stop giving the government an interestfree loan or at least reduce the size of that loan by increasing the number of allowances you claim on your Form Wnum
Tax preparers recommend reviewing the number of allowances you claim every time you have a major life event such as the birth of a child marriage or a home purchase
There are free calculators available online that will help you estimate how many allowances you should claim

In num the Red Cliff Veterans of Foreign Wars Post was on the verge of folding its colors forever
With a depleted membership roll and a tiny woodframed clubhouse with few amenities the organization appeared moribund and the few remaining members were informed by the national organization that because of the posts inactivity its charter was going to be canceled
It is an alltoo familiar scenario for the national service organization today
With memberships made up mostly of elderly World War II and Korea vets there are few new members signing up and older organizations dating back to the First World War have cased their banners for the last time
But there were some at Red Cliff who were not willing to see that happen to their post however humble it may have appeared
Born on June num num with a membership of num the Red Cliff VFW represented the proud spirit of patriotism of the Ojibwa people whose roots of military service go back to an elite corps of Union sharpshooters during the Civil War
Red Cliff men and women have served in every conflict since answering the call of duty from the SpanishAmerican War to Vietnam from Iraq to Afghanistan
They have fallen in those conflicts as well and almost the first act of the newly reawakened Red Cliff VFW was to change the name of the organization to the Duwayne Soulier Memorial VFW Post num
It was appropriate that the Red Cliff VFW should be renamed after Soulier a United States Marine who was killed in action in Vietnam in num
Souliers portrait occupies the place of central honor on the structures Wall of Fame
Above the photo is an original oil painting by artist Larry Bychowski showing Soulier a feather in his GI helmet in a scene from the field in Vietnam
Presiding over the rebirth has been Post Commander Daniel Gordon who took over from thenpost commander Don Gurnoe
I owned a bar up north here said Gordon
I started inviting the VFW guys out there after Memorial Day services serving them a lunch
Finally Don told me they were going to shut it down and he asked if I would consider being the commander because I was so active with it
Gordon a Vietnam veteran said he thought about it and finally agreed
Within a short period of time under his enthusiastic leadership and that of Quartermaster Randy Bresette the club boasted num lifetime members and a Womens Auxiliary with num members
In recognition of this turnaround the revitalized VFW post was awarded a Perpetual Charter in num
The group even organized a unit to carry the colors in the Apple Festival parade
We have a real active corps of members now said Bresette
Based on the renewed strength and enthusiasm of the membership discussions began on plans to reconstruct both the VFW and its ladies auxiliary organization
They began fundraising for the project and gutted the old structure pouring a new numfoot slab and building the new facility from scratch
Weve been providing our own labor through volunteers from the membership as much as we possibly could Gordon said
This and generous donations from organizations throughout the area have enabled the club to rebuild a beautiful new $num structure and emerge debtfree
The whole purpose of the effort has not merely been to build a shiny new clubhouse for the membership Gordon said
We want to have fish fries and things that will raise funds for our projects he said
Those efforts include assistance and fundraisers for the membership and community people when needed educational efforts youth groups and other charitable efforts
The main clubhouse area is complete and was recently dedicated during ceremonies on May num an event attended by local and regional veterans officials state legislators and others
The next phase which will be funded through proceeds from the bar will be the construction of a new kitchen facility
Once that is in place events like Friday night fish fries and benefits will be possible
The goal is always to help the community Gordon said
Everything that comes through here just goes back out to the community he said
It is a project that the entire community has taken pride in said Bresette
Theyve been watching the progress he said
One thing that stands out most at the structure is the Wall of Fame which will one day house photos of every Red Cliff Town of Russell City of Bayfield and Town of Bayfield veteran the members can obtain
Its a testimony to all who have served in the area said Gordon
The wall was a favorite at the dedication as was the commemoration of Soulier which also included a rubbing of Souliers name from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington DC

Portugals government announced a tough program of pay cuts and tax hikes Wednesday moving to check a deepening financial crisis that has stoked fears about the ailing countrys economic future and weakened confidence in the shared euro currency
Prime Minister Jose Socrates said his centerleft Socialist government wants a num percent cut in public sector pay for those earning more than num a month and a freeze on civil service promotions and pension levels next year
To increase revenue the government intends to raise sales tax to num percent from num percent
The measures will bring savings of num billion and will raise an additional num billion in revenue Socrates said
the amount it spent more than it had
stood at num percent of gross domestic product last year
It was the fourthhighest deficit in the eurozone and rattled international faith in the financial soundness of the euro currency which is shared by num countries including Portugal
Socrates said the drastic measures were needed to protect the countrys credibility
to reassure jittery international investors that the country is working its way back to fiscal wellbeing
They will help to remove doubts and uncertainties that have attached to Portugal he said after an unscheduled Cabinet meeting convened to discuss the debt crisis
The government also needs to address investor fears about the countrys ability to service its huge debt burden
The cost of borrowing on international markets has surged to euroera records in recent days as investors demand bigger returns for risking their money in Portugal
Portugals economy is one of the most fragile in the numnation euro zone after Greece
Though Portugal accounts for less than num percent of the blocs gross domestic product its financial difficulties could undermine wider faith in the soundness of the shared currency
Portugals anemic economic growth and mounting debts have fueled concerns it might require an international bailout like the one that rescued Greece from looming bankruptcy in May
However to enact the measures the minority centerleft Socialist government needs the consent of opposition parties which together outnumber it in Parliament and can block legislation
The main opposition Social Democratic Party has previously said it would not endorse any more tax increases
The government raised sales tax to num percent from num in a first raft of measures in May
The measures are part of the governments num state budget proposal which is a key tool in the effort to restore fiscal health
The budget bill will go to Parliament next month
The government which has offered to negotiate with the main opposition centerright Social Democratic Party has warned it will not be able to run the country if it has no budget
However it has stopped short of saying it will resign if its budget proposal is rejected
As well as political opposition the government faces a popular outcry over the cuts
Unions said at least num people turned out for a march in Lisbon on Wednesday against the governments austerity policies which have hurt pockets
The rising interest rates and growing unemployment
now close to num percent
have accelerated the drain on public finances

Its a huge responsibility said Revels Robinson and I dont think any of us takes it lightly
In meetings Revels Robinson has had with Childrens Administration CA employees since becoming assistant secretary two months ago she tells staff she has worked in every program and nearly every job in the business
It doesnt make me an expert but it has given me experience and understanding said Revels Robinson num
Revels Robinson graduated from West Virginia State University in num with a degree in sociology and she worked as a social worker in New York City and Washington DC She served as director of childwelfare agencies in two Midwestern states and was a consultant on a federal panel evaluating family services
For most of the past decade she worked as director of the Bureau of Milwaukee Child Welfare a staterun county childwelfare system in Wisconsin
In num a nummonthold Milwaukee boy was killed by his aunt despite repeated visits from a private social worker under contract with the staterun agency
Revels Robinson who as head of the agency bore the brunt of early criticism over the death asked to be transferred to a position where she could advise on policies to prevent child deaths
A numyear career in child welfare cannot be judged by one tragic incident said Susan Dreyfus secretary of the state Department of Social and Health Services who worked closely with Revels Robinson in Wisconsin and encouraged her to compete for the position in Washington state
Anybody who has been in this field long enough knows this could happen to them said Dreyfus explaining that the death of children at their caretakers hands tragic as it is is not always preventable
Deaths can happen even when social workers have done everything by the book and taken every allowable precaution she said
Revels Robinson she said is among the finest childwelfare advocates in the country
Denise will prove in very short order that she is the right person for this job
In any given year the Childrens Administration receives about num referrals for abused or neglected children and has about num children in foster care
Last year the administration conducted num reviews into the deaths of children receiving services from Childrens Administration
Of those num were determined to have resulted from abuse or neglect at the hands of a parent guardian licensed provider or a parents partner
In its reviews of the deaths the administration determined that social workers in one case failed to take critical steps that could have alerted social workers to the serious risk posed to the child by the mothers boyfriend
Critics of the administration on both the right and left say Revels Robinson is inheriting a deeply flawed system
Some claim the Childrens Administration routinely takes children away from good families but leaves others with bad ones
Some critics claim social workers are overworked and overburdened with administrative duties
Others claim they have too much power and that the system fails when it relies on the judgment of individuals
Many say the administration is too large and unwieldy
They argue that it should be broken down into smaller agencies or dismantled and rebuilt from scratch
But the system in Milwaukee that Revels Robinson inherited was far more troubled according to Thomas Shapley a spokesman for Washington State Department of Social and Health Services which oversees Childrens Administration
Milwaukee he said is a tough tough urban setting
Milwaukee was under a court order to reform its childwelfare system when Revels Robinson took the helm
During her tenure the number of Milwaukee children in state care declined from num to num the number of adoptions tripled and num percent of children were reunified safely with their parents
Jess McDonald previous director of Illinois Department of Children and Family Services who has worked with Revels Robinson for years spoke highly of her
She understands the complex nature of the childwelfare system and has demonstrated an ability to improve childwelfaresystem performance in the area of safety permanency and wellbeing McDonald has said
Like Milwaukee Washington state is under a court order to reform its childwelfare system as a result of a landmark court case which became known as the Braam Settlement in which a judge ordered the state among other things to reduce the number of times foster children are moved from one home to another
Like many others who devote a lifetime to child services Revels Robinson said she felt called to her career
She had she says nearly an ideal childhood
Her mother was a devoted homemaker who volunteered at church and with the Girl Scouts
Her grandparents had a farm in West Virginia where she and her sisters spent their summers
Her father was a New York City police officer tall and commanding
He had a stern look that quelled the mischief of neighborhood kids but a soft spot for his daughters
It has been num years since he died but she still tears up at the thought of him
My father was as steady as a rock said Revels Robinson
We knew we could always count on him
When she was num her parents opened their home to four foster children who became permanent members of her family
I realized that I was very blessed to have the family I did said Revels Robinson
I always thought it was important to give back
Among Revels Robinsons top goals are safely reducing the number of children in foster care and safely lowering the number of children who are removed from their homes initially by providing more services to families
The goal is giving parents the resources they need to take care of their children rather than separating families she said
Another priority is building relationships between her agency and other agencies both public and private that also work for the good of children
There are a lot of champions for children in this state she said
And we all need to work together
Revels Robinson said she urges her staff to take time for themselves and their families and to remember when they get to work that they need to be fully there for the children they are supposed to protect
I wish we didnt have to exist
I wish that no child was abused or neglected but thats not the reality
When we do have to take a child we need to get them into a permanent place quickly and safely
And we need to remember that we are not talking about data we are talking about children and we need to remember their faces
Information from The Seattle Times httpwwwseattletimescom
German carmaker Audi AG said Thursday it would invest euronum million $num billion to extend its production site in Hungary
About num jobs will be added at the plant in Gyor in western Hungary where Audi builds engines and assembles cars like the TT Roadster TT Coupe and Anum models
Audi Hungaria now employs more than num people
The plants extension over the next three years will put Audi in a position to meet its ambitious growth targets Audi CEO Rupert Stadler said
The Gyor plant is expected to produce around num cars a year from num and Audi plans to sell num million cars a year by num up from around num in num Stadler said
To continue this growth rate in a sustained manner we need further capacity like what we are going to establish in our Hungarian location Stadler said at a news conference held in parliament with Prime Minister Viktor Orban
Audi recently purchased a numhectare numacre plot next to its existing factory in Gyor for euronum million $num million to carry out the expansion which will allow the plant to have its own complete production line
At present the cars body shells are made at an Audi plant in Ingolstadt Germany and shipped by rail to Gyor
Environmentalists have raised concerns about the expansion which is planned on a former military shooting range which is now part of a nature reserve
Orban said all constructions permits including environmental authorizations would be obtained in time for the project to go ahead as planned
Audi also said its board and the workers council agreed to extend an existing job guarantee for Audis German plants in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm throughout num
Audi a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG has seen its sales rising sharply in recent months driven by strong exports
A US senator with an influential voice in the dispute over a littleused border post between Montana and Canada said Wednesday that officials should scrap an $num million stimulusfunded upgrade and shut down the underused crossing
Sen Jon Tester said Canada which surprised US officials by closing its side of the Whitetail port this summer was not interested in sharing a new station or fully reopening its side of the border
He said a renovation to the port going into Saskatchewan no longer makes sense
The port is one of a few that services a rural and long stretch of the border in northeastern Montana
Residents say it is largely used by farmers who live in the area for trade and convenience
Federal officials say they cant keep the border station open without modernizing security
Before terrorism became a chief concern the station closed for the night by placing orange cones in the road
The border is only as strong as the weakest link
Quite honestly we couldnt leave a subpar station up there without the upgrade the Democrat told The Associated Press
What has happened since then is Canada has said Well we are not going to deal with it
Tester said that Canada told US officials it would remotely monitor its side of the port for just car traffic
if the Unites States paid for the technology at a cost of up to $num million
What really kind of made the decision for me is that Canada was not going to be allowing trucks up from the US
It would just be car traffic only Tester said
I dont want to get into a position where we are paying for Canadian border protection services
I dont think thats a good precedent
Last month US Customs and Border Protection officials suspended construction based in part on Testers recommendation
The senator lined up Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to visit then held his own meeting last week with residents of the small town of Scobey
Testers stance is expected to carry weight with the federal officials who will make the final call
A spokesman for the border agency said federal officials are still weighing the options
We appreciate Senator Testers input and we will continue to work closely with our partners in Congress state and local officials as well as the Canada Border Services Agency as we determine the best path forward regarding the future of the Whitetail port of entry including any decision to close the port said Rafael Lemaitre
The episode underscores the criticism leveled against the US government for spending more than $num million in federal stimulus funding to upgrade that and four other Montana border posts
US Rep Denny Rehberg a Republican has bashed the administration for launching the rehab in the first place
He recommended closure after holding his own public meeting on the issue and said operating hours at nearby crossings could be expanded to accommodate farmers who might be inconvenienced by closing Whitetail
Construction on the Whitetail port should be stopped permanently and not one more penny of taxpayer dollars should be spent modernizing a facility that serves only five cars per day Rehberg said in a statement Wednesday
Its what Montanans in Daniels County told me last month and its what the American people have been saying about wasteful spending for years
Proponents defend the legislation signed Friday by Gov
Jan Brewer as legally sound
But critics say the US Constitution makes it clear that the federal government alone has the responsibility to enact and enforce immigration laws
Some fear other constitutional rights will be trampled through racial profiling and that vital federal money will be diverted from other national priorities
Under the tough new law which goes into effect num days after the legislative session ends it will be a state crime for undocumented immigrants to be in Arizona
It is the only state with such a law
Some provisions of the farreaching Arizona legislation opponents predict will lead to racial profiling and possible violations of the Fourth Amendment which guarantees the right against unreasonable searches and seizures and the numth Amendment which guarantees equal protection under the law
Under Arizonas law local lawenforcement officers will have the authority to ask about immigration status if they have a reasonable suspicion that a person is undocumented
Its extraordinarily vulnerable to a legal challenge said Thomas Saenz president and general counsel of the Los Angelesbased Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and an attorney who in the nums helped overturn most of the provisions of Californias immigrationrelated Proposition num
I expect multiple lawsuits in federal and possibly state courts he said
The ugly specter of racial profiling which violates civil rights has drawn rebukes from Democrats and Republicans alike
On Friday President Barack Obama said he has directed administration officials to closely monitor the civilrights implications of the Arizona law
Newly appointed interim Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley a Republican also expressed civilrights concerns last week when urging Brewer to veto the bill
Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon a Democrat signaled Friday that he intends to pursue a lawsuit
The Justice Department also could try to intervene legally
Under the Constitutions supremacy clause the Constitution and federal law trump state law
Article num of the Constitution which spells out Congress powers specifically gives US lawmakers authority to establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization and to regulate commerce with other nations
Opponents of individual state action on immigration argue a uniform national immigration policy makes sense and is preferable to a patchwork of different laws in different states
Timing is not clear but legal experts speculate that certain immediate challenges to the law such as the argument that federal authority is supreme on immigration could result in a judge blocking the law from ever taking effect
Other challenges such as those claiming racial profiling may require enforcement of the law first to create a test case
In Saenzs view the Arizona law not only wrongly usurps federal authority on immigration it also brazenly tries to unilaterally redirect scarce US resources to the state at the expense of other national immigration priorities
Only the federal government can deport illegal immigrants
What they expect to happen obviously is a whole bunch of people would be picked up by Arizona police and turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Saenz said
Well that then forces ICE to divert resources to Arizona when they have made a decision on a national basis to direct limited resources in ways that are consistent with the enforcement priorities set by the federal government not by any state or local government
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano Brewers predecessor as Arizona governor on Friday echoed those concerns
The Arizona immigration law will likely hinder federal law enforcement from carrying out its priorities of detaining and removing dangerous criminal aliens she said
State Sen Russell Pearce RMesa the Arizona measures sponsor and other supporters counter that the bill is constitutional and that opponents are misrepresenting the potential for racial profiling and other abuses
But they are bracing for incoming litigation
Pearce the architect of several immigrationrelated Arizona laws last week noted that a state law establishing penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal workers faced similar criticism before it went into effect on Jan num num but it has been upheld in US District Court and the numth US
Since num when we passed Proposition num just to stop voter fraud and welfare fraud Ive been sued seven times won seven times Pearce said Wednesday in an interview on MSNBC
Employer sanctions Ive been sued five times won five times
Kris Kobach a law professor at the University of MissouriKansas City School of Law who counseled Pearce when he was writing Senate Bill num said Arizona simply is taking action on what Congress already has deemed illegal so the state is not infringing on federal authority or running afoul of the supremacy clause
The bill basically makes it a penalty under state law to do what is already a crime under federal law he said
If the state is concurrently prohibiting the same behavior that the federal government is then the state is not preempted and is acting consistently with Congress objectives
Auto supplier China Automotive Systems Inc said Monday its net income leaped num percent due to higher revenue amid an uptick in the global auto industry
But the company didnt satisfy Wall Street in its fullyear revenue forecast
Shares fell num percent or $num to close at $num
The company earned $num million or num cents per share in the secondquarter compared with $num million or num cents per share a year earlier
Revenue jumped num percent to $num million from $num million a year earlier
The companys margins fell slightly because of lower prices
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of num cents per share on revenue of $num million
The company said its ramping up production for Chrysler as the US auto market continues on an upswing
The Chinese company which makes steering components began supplying parts to Chrysler for the Jeep Wrangler in midnum
Chrysler is China Automotive Systems first major customer outside China

Whole Foods Market Inc may have beaten estimates in the third quarter but analysts said the upscale grocers sales and margin growth is slowing and the company is already logging weak numbers in its fourth quarter
Shares fell $num or num percent to $num in premarket trading Wednesday
The company said late Tuesday that its thirdquarter net income jumped sharply and raised its fullyear guidance although it noted that revenue at stores open at least a year decelerated in the first four weeks in the fourth quarter
Thats a key figure for retailers because it measures growth at existing stores
The Austin Texas natural and organic grocer offered an initial num pershare outlook of $num to $num
Hapoalim Securities analyst Ajay Jain said the outlook appears aggressive and that it is based on growth of revenue at stores open at least a year to grow between num percent and num percent calling that a very tall order
Credit Suisse analyst Edward J Kelly said the figure is slowing and investors will debate about what growth rates are sustainable and how to value the company
We therefore believe the stock will struggle over the next few quarters until visibility on the outlook improves especially if the consumer remains weak he told clients in a note
He noted the average price per item fell less than num percent in the third quarter compared with the second
Shoppers had pulled back spending at the upscale grocer in the weak economy as they tried to save money
Whole Foods has cut prices and offered less expensive options to keep people coming into its stores
Jain said this is evidence that the competitive environment is getting more challenging
Whole Foods is obviously not immune from macro headwinds affecting an increasingly wide range of consumer staples and discretionary stores he said
He maintained his earnings per share estimates of $num for the year and $num for next year while Kelly cut his fiscal num estimate to $num from $num but raised his num estimate to $num from $num
Analysts on average expect $num for fiscal num and $num for fiscal num according to Thomson Reuters

Dudley was vague on that point when he floated his idea Thursday and he deserves whatever criticism comes his way for proposing a new state program without a financing plan
Yet the proposal itself is not a fantasy
Other states have scholarship programs such as the one Dudley has called for and Oregons ambition should be to join them
Dudleys Oregon Future Fund Scholarship program would provide full scholarships to public universities or $num scholarships to private colleges to students who need financial assistance and who graduate from high school with gradepoint averages between num and num
Students with GPAs of num or better would be offered the scholarships regardless of financial need
The scholarships are part of a larger numpoint plan released by Dudley Educating for Our Economic Future
The plan does not include estimates of the number of students who would participate or of the cost to the state
Based on other states experience the number would be large and the cost would be high
The prototype is Georgias Help Outstanding Pupils Educationally program which since num has offered a free college education to all students who graduate from the states high schools with a GPA of num or better
The program pays tuition fees and a $num book allowance at Georgias state universities and it offers a $numasemester subsidy for students attending private colleges
The scholarships are funded with revenues from Georgias lottery
More than num students receive HOPE scholarships and the cost to the state is about $num million a year
Twenty states have imitated Georgia with varying scholarship amounts and GPA requirements
In Georgia and elsewhere there have been predictable effects grade inflation in high schools and rising tuition
The HOPE program and its counterparts elsewhere are having financial problems as student demand exceeds revenues leading many to close the programs to highincome families or impose other limits
Still these states have found ways to make higher education affordable for their most promising students
Their programs address the worsening problems of access and student debt while widening the pipeline of educated people entering the workforce see editorial below
Students graduating from high school with high GPAs today are likely to become the business civic and professional leaders of tomorrow
A state serves its longterm economic and social interests by making an instate college education attractive to those students because many of those who go to outofstate schools never return
Oregons efforts along these lines have involved scholarships awarded on the basis of need rather than on some measure of merit such as test scores or GPAs
Ted Kulongoski has expanded the Oregon Opportunity Grant program for students from lowincome families but its scope remains modest compared to that of the HOPE program and its ilk
A program like the one Dudley proposes would be welcome in Oregon and hes right to draw the connection between higher education and the economy
What Oregonians need from Dudley now is a workable plan for financing such scholarships
Albany DemocratHerald on how state should push for nuclear reactors as a power source
Oregon has a requirement that electric utilities obtain num percent of their power from renewable resources such as wind and solar
Even if the goal is met that still leaves Oregon getting three quarters of its electrical power from conventional sources including coal and natural gas
If Oregon leadership had been smart it would have allowed wind and solar to develop on their own
Oregon would have pushed instead to promote
with state law changes and appeals to Congress and federal regulators
the kind of nuclear reactors that a Corvallis company is designing
The company is NuScale formed in num
It has designed smallscale nuclear reactors ideally suited to power American cities one at a time without relying on fossil fuels needing no longdistance transmission systems and reliable regardless of whether the wind blows or the sun shines
NuScale reactors would be small num feet in diameter and could be built in factories instead of on site
One module would be enough to power a town about the size of Albany
The modules could be arranged in series for bigger cities
They operate under ground without cooling towers
In short they sound ideal for Americas energy situation
They could replace all the current gasfired electric generation leaving all that natural gas to power our cars and trucks of the future which raises the possibility of making us independent of oil imports from places like Venezuela and the Middle East
But our political leaders are either not interested as in Oregon or in absolutely no hurry as at the federal level
Obama has talked about encouraging nuclear power but done nothing to follow up
The Oregon company expects to submit documents for certification of its design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in num
Approval is not expected until num
Our federal legislators constantly talk of energy independence
If they meant it our laws would encourage NuScaletype reactors to be certified built and rushed into use
The Bulletin on ballot proposal to renew a measure that dedicates part of state lottery funds to parks and wildlife conservation
The most important thing voters should know about ballot Measure num is that its completely unnecessary
It asks voters to make a decision now that theyd otherwise make in num
Dont Oregonians and their elected leaders have enough to worry about these days without borrowing policy debates from the future
Measure num is backed by The Nature Conservancy which spent more than $num million getting it on the ballot
In simple terms it would extend the effects of a num ballot measure indefinitely
dedicated num percent of Oregon State Lottery funds to parks and wildlife habitat
The setaside sunsets in num but Measure num requires a vote in num that would give Oregonians a chance to extend it
In essence Measure num simply moves the question forward by four years
If it doesnt pass however the num vote will still occur
You dont have to be a public policy junkie to recognize The Nature Conservancys bad timing
Most of the Lottery funds Measure num pulls aside for recreational and environmental uses would otherwise be available for public schools which these days are struggling
School districts wouldnt see any of that Lottery money for a few years anyway but its hard to imagine a worse time to dangle millions of dollars in redirected school funding in front of teachers faces and ask Can we have this forever
Because Measure num sets up a battle between environmental groups and public education supporters
legislative leaders have engaged in some damage control and promised a fix
If Measure num passes according to The Oregonian the Legislature intends to place a followup measure on the num ballot that would limit its potential harm to public schools
Among other things the promised num measure would allow lawmakers to keep the num percent Lottery setaside in times of crisis
So to recap In a matter of weeks Oregonians will weigh in on a completely unnecessary ballot measure that will require a damagecontrol measure in num
Voters should save themselves and legislators a substantial headache and vote no
This is a matter that can wait until num
Drug distributor McKesson Corp spent $num in the second quarter as it lobbied Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services on issues including contracts and health care reform

A medical journal is criticizing Canada for exporting asbestos to poor countries joining others who have condemned the practice as hypocritical
A report in the journal Lancet on Thursday notes that Canada virtually bans the use of asbestos
But unlike other rich nations it remains a major exporter of chrysotile or white asbestos
The Canadian Minister of Natural Resources office said its practice has a sound scientific basis
Asbestos is a natural mineral which can be processed for use in rooftops piping or building materials
Inhaling its fibers scars the lungs and can lead to respiratory diseases including cancers
The World Health Organization says all types of asbestos cause cancer and more than num countries have banned it
About num people die every year from asbestosrelated diseases and num million people remain exposed to the deadly substance worldwide
Canada is the worlds fourth biggest exporter of asbestos after Russia Kazakhstan and Brazil
Last year Canada shipped num tons to countries including India Indonesia and the Philippines where few laws exist to protect people from asbestos
In Canada the government has spent millions of dollars removing asbestos from buildings across the country including its Parliament
Numerous Canadian organizations including the Quebec Medical Association Canadian Cancer Society and the Canadian Medical Association have labeled Canadas asbestos exportation as deplorable shameful and unethical
They describe it as Prime Minister Stephen Harpers killer legacy
Canada should not be exporting asbestos to developing nations where there are few or no workplace regulations Richard Horton editor of the Lancet said in a statement
He called for an end to this immoral export of asbestosrelated death and disease to some of the most vulnerable people in the world
The report was written by the Lancets Tony Kirby
With asbestos deposits dwindling in Quebec where Canadas asbestos is mined the industry appeared doomed
But an international consortium proposed converting a closed mine into a new operation that could produce about num ton of white asbestos a year
Quebec is considering providing a $num million loan guarantee for the project according to previous published statements by the provincial government
The international consortium that wants to reopen the mine claims Canadian asbestos is only sold to manufacturers with responsible use practices in place
Developers said all the mined asbestos would be sent abroad with about half of it going to India
The consortium also said they would use pictures to instruct people on the safe and responsible usage of asbestos
The office of the Canadian Minister of Natural Resources said they believe the risks linked to asbestos can be managed
Canadas policy of controlled use has a sound scientific basis and is a responsible approach said Paul Duchesne a spokesman for the minister in an emailed statement
Through the enforcement of appropriate regulations to rigorously control exposure to white asbestos the health risks associated with processes and products can be reduced to acceptable levels Duchesne said
The Canadian government says the risks from white asbestos can be managed in controlled conditions like if the substance is covered by another material so the asbestos layer is not releasing dust
Kathleen Ruff a senior human rights adviser to the Rideau Institute an independent research and advocacy organization in Ottawa said that exporting asbestos and refusing to alert poor countries to its dangers Canada is intentionally doing harm
In num Canada led an effort to block a United Nations convention that would have made it mandatory to warn countries of hazardous substances like asbestos she said
Canada has blood on its hands Ruff said
What we are doing is unconscionable
The whole world should condemn us
Protesters plan to hit the street this week in Asia London and Quebec to demand a global ban on asbestos in any building materials
ALBANY NY The parade was moving either too slow or too fast for Carl Paladino
The numyearold Republican gubernatorial candidate was marching down New York Citys numth Avenue in the Columbus Day Parade like he owned the street
Passing through a gauntlet of boos and cheers he had made comments critical of homosexuality a day earlier Paladino had a bemused tightlipped grin over his face
shouted one man who had torn up a campaign sign for his Democratic rival Andrew Cuomo and threw it onto the street like it was confetti
Go back to Buffalo you loser
shouted another man further uptown
Paladino was surrounded by a gaggle of media straining to hear him speak and supporters waving orangeandblue Paladino campaign signs
Whenever Paladino paused to shake someones hand dole out a lollipop to a child or stop to answer questions the parade would move by him
When he would eagerly stride ahead of the halted marching bands and the slowmoving floats to dive into the crowd to slap highfives he would soon have to stop and turn around to find his proper spot in the parade
The march was emblematic of his campaign for governor loud disorganized and proudly upending the order of things
Paladino hopes to make his case to voters with five pledges cut taxes slash spending attract jobs rollback onerous regulations on businesses and root out public corruption
Not that many voters have heard that message
A series of controversies have overshadowed the campaign making it difficult for him to talk policy
Paladinos description of gaypride parades as disgusting tripped up the campaign
He got into a heated argument with a reporter over photographing his outofwedlock daughter that became a viral video on the Internet
He claimed that he had evidence of Cuomos affairs prior to a num divorce but none has surfaced so far
Hes forwarded lewd emails that included pictures of President Barack Obama and the first lady dressed as a pimp and prostitute and raunchy pornography
Paladino issued apologies for some of the emails hes sent and for the comments about homosexuality
Despite his plans to spend up to $num million of his own $num million fortune Paladino a wealthy Buffalo businessman so far hasnt unleashed all of that money since much of it is tied up in realestate holdings and he has struggled to raise money
He lags behind Cuomo by doubledigits in opinion polls and even some Republicans are shaking their heads at his campaign
A Siena College poll released Monday showed Paladino trailing Cuomo num percentage points a gap that may prove difficult to overcome
Yet he is banking on tapping into voter outrage across the state on Election Day Nov num
Paladino who plans to only serve one fouryear term remains undeterred
Im energized by this thing Paladino said in an interview in Manhattan a few hours after the parade
Im out there telling people how I feel on every issue
Paladino has portrayed his Democratic rival as an Albany insider who cant be trusted to lead
He also blames Cuomo the secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration for setting in motion the collapse of the housing market
In turn Democrats have criticized Paladino for receiving millions of dollars in tax breaks from a defunct economic development program on buildings he owns and for not creating many jobs with the tax credits
Most of New York was introduced to Paladino earlier this year when he launched his unlikely bid for governor despite appeals from Republican leaders he run for another post
Supporters say Paladino is a hero in Buffalo for creating jobs and providing a blunt voice for the workingclass upstate voter upset with state government
Longtime detractors watching his campaign unfold with a series of controversies arent surprised and say that his overthetop style makes him unfit to be governor
Theres such a sense of frustration and anger in so much of the electorate directed at Albany the state government and the Legislature and he had the ability to tap into that said Steve Greenberg a Siena College pollster
But he has gone from the angry man to I think in the voters minds the wild man
It was only until last year that Paladino considered running for governor
Paladino said several events played a role in his decision to run but a family tragedy was at the center
His youngest son Patrick num was killed in a car accident in March num
Collins said Patricks death defined Paladino over the last year
He carries that loss with him everyday Collins said
I think the loss of his son has propelled him into this role of doing more
I think he has a sense of urgency associated with that
Paladino campaigns with Patricks pitbull Duke in tow as a daily reminder of his son
He has another son William and two daughters Danielle and Sarah
I learned a lot about the fragility of life that was a major factor Paladino said about his decision to run
As Paladino tells it the tea party movement the populistconservative movement that arose after the num elections drafted him
I was approached by a couple of tea party people about running and I said You guys are nuts Im not a politician Paladino said
They kept on me they pressed me
I soon realized that Im probably the only guy who can do this
Paladino also met with former Rep Rick Lazio who had already declared his intention to run for governor and found him weak and immature
Paladino defeated Lazio the partys preferred candidate by a wide margin in the Sept num primary
Paladino shrugs off his critics who he charges are part of a cabal that has fleeced the public for too long
It is a message that he has honed in on during his tumultuous campaign no matter the outcome
You cant define me within the politically correct rules and regulations he said
I dont care if the press is num percent against me what I care about is the people
Ive suffered the worst of horrors in life nobody could ever hurt me worse than that hurt me

President Barack Obama played wingman Friday heaping praise on Senate Majority Harry Reid and urging a divided electorate to choose his friend over Republican Sharron Angle
Harry is not the flashiest guy lets face it Obama said to peals of laughter outside a Las Vegas middle school
Harry kind of speaks in a very soft voice
He doesnt move very quickly
He doesnt get up and make big stemwinding speeches
But Harry does the right thing
At one point Obama interrupted the crowds chants
I appreciate everyone saying Obama but I want everyone to say Harry Harry Harry Obama instructed leading the crowd
Obamas getoutthevote rally followed similar visits in Portland Los Angeles and Seattle where a string of close contests could hand the House and Senate over to the GOP
In Nevada where the US Senate race is locked in a dead heat at question is whether Obamas coattails have shrunk since his historic num victory that saw the Silver State turn blue

Reid has targeted minority voters
We never give up do we Nevadans
he said drawing a smattering of applause
A few streets away for sale signs lined a modest neighborhood
Foreclosures have devastated the once family friendly area said Jerry Mastro a numyearold construction worker who was lured to Las Vegas five years ago by stories of ample opportunity
I havent seen things get better and neither has anyone else in Las Vegas Ill tell you that said Mastro an independent voter turned off by Reid and Angle
The underemployed were among those who came out to hear Obama
Stephanie Johnson a single mother of three young sons amassed $num in student loans to become a medical assistant but hasnt found work in her field
To feed her children she braids her friends hair and cleans houses
Reid seems sympathetic to her troubles she concluded Friday as she waited for the rally to start
All the problems arent because of him
At least he is trying Johnson said
Jay Jackson a numyearold Las Vegas day laborer who clocks num hours during good weeks said voters who blame their problems on Obama have short memories
He hasnt even been in office that long and before he even got in there were a lot of problems Jackson said
Reid acknowledged the dismal unemployment figures at a news conference earlier Friday where he heralded thousands of new jobs in roadway construction the latest jobs event he has held in the final days of the election
We found ourselves in a hole that I didnt dig but I have dug dug and dug to try to get out of that hole Reid said
Republicans dismissed the notion that Obama might provide a muchneeded boast to their opponents
Angle greeted the presidential invasion with a new television spot titled Welcome to Nevada Mr
The ad contrasts Obamas uplifting promises as a candidate against Nevadas dark economy

Facebook is trying to make it easier for people to share their updates selectively and draw distinctions between friends family members and coworkers on the Webs biggest social hub
Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks founder and CEO unveiled the latest changes Wednesday at a press conference that marked his first public appearance since last Fridays debut of The Social Network a movie tracing Facebooks origins and evolution
The movie depicts Zuckerberg as a misanthropic genius who relied on a combination of talent and treachery to build Facebook into a cultural touchstone since he began working on it in a Harvard University dorm room more than six years ago
Zuckerberg told reporters Wednesday he wouldnt discuss the critically acclaimed film which has been a boxoffice hit so far
He has previously scoffed at the movie as a gross exaggeration and said he didnt intend to see it
He had much more to say about Facebooks features which he said Facebooks engineers had been working on during the past two months while in lockdown mode
The project was aimed at making it easier to sort Facebook friendships into separate clusters such as college chums drinking buddies coworkers neighbors and family
That in turn is intended to make people more comfortable about posting observations and pictures for which they only want a limited audience
Facebook already offers a way to do this through a lists feature
But only about num percent of Facebooks more than num million users take the time to use this tool to carve up their friendships
No one wants to make lists Zuckerberg said
The new feature is called groups and started rolling out Wednesday
It will allow people to set up pages consisting of people who share the same interests or family affiliation
Group members can post information only other members can see and they will be able to convene in chat rooms
Members also will be able to plan events together
Each step on the road to making Facebook an indispensible way to communicate makes it more attractive to advertisers
That in turn helps to bring in revenue as the privately held company gears up for an initial public offering expected within two years
Zuckerberg believes num percent of Facebook users eventually will be touched by the group feature in some fashion either by creating groups or being sorted into groups
We arent trying to be hyperbolic in saying that this is going to be a fundamental shift in how people will use Facebook Zuckerberg said
Facebook imported some of the ideas for the groups feature from a startup called Hot Potato that it bought during the summer
Hot Potato founder Justin Shaffer is the product manager for the groups tool
To give users even more peace of mind about what they are sharing Facebook is making it possible for them to download digital copies of all the personal data they have on the website
Its also introducing a dashboard to monitor personal information used by games quizzes and other applications distributed on Facebook
To guard against hackers downloading other peoples personal information Facebook will send users emails whenever information requests are made and take a series of other security steps
David Paterson on Tuesday sought a propertytax cap on local governments but not on schools a sign that a schoolpropertytax cap is unlikely this year
Paterson had proposed a schoolpropertytax cap to help lower taxes in New York one of the highest taxed states in the country because schools make up more than num percent of a homeowners tax bill
But with support for a cap on school taxes waning particularly in the state Assembly Paterson said he is seeking a compromise Cap the taxes on the other num percent of a homeowners tax bill which includes taxes from local governments and any special taxing districts
But even as Paterson proposed it he was quick to say the measure faced an uphill climb with legislative leaders who he presented the plan to privately on Tuesday
I would like to see propertytax relief for the overwhelming number of citizens in this state whove indicated that they need it and they want it Paterson said
I was looking for a compromise and in this case I dont think we have gotten one but well keep trying
Patersons aides however said the governor will introduce the measure as a bill for the Legislature to consider and wouldnt rule out including it in his next budget proposal Monday his deadline to pass a state budget
The governors proposal would limit property taxes on local governments to num percent a year or num percent of the rate of inflation
Stephen Acquario executive director of the state Association of Counties said the state is the one that has forced higher taxes on the local level through unfunded mandates such as healthcare spending
If the state wants a tax cap they should reduce the mandates which account for as much as num percent of county budgets he said
Its about time somebody at the state level took responsibility for their own actions Acquario said
At the county level the state has been raising county property taxes for decades
Patersons aides said the governor has sought numerous ways to lower the mandates on local governments including proposing a fouryear moratorium on unfunded mandates
Sen Jeff Klein DBronx has been pushing for propertytax relief in the state budget and said Patersons proposal should be coupled with a cap on school taxes
But Klein said lawmakers are considering a plan to restore some of the $num billion in cuts Paterson proposed to schools and requiring districts to use the additional aid to lower property taxes
Robert Lowry deputy director for the state Council of School Superintendents said schools should not be restricted in how they would use any restoration in aid saying districts could restore programs and jobs if additional aid was received or use it for propertytax relief
School budgets largely passed last month based on Patersons $num billion proposed cuts lawmakers are considering adding back about $num million
Its hard for me to see how you can construct a law that makes sense for every district Lowry said
Meanwhile Paterson dismissed any notion that he plans to back away from his pledge to put the remaining pieces of the budget into next weeks extender on Monday
The num fiscal year started April num but the Legislature has yet to reach a deal with Paterson to close a $num billion budget gap
Instead the Legislature has been passing oneweek extenders to keep state government operating and Paterson has been including many of his budget proposals into the extenders forcing lawmakers to pass them or shut down state government
He said he will put the remainder of his budget proposal including school cuts into next weeks extender to close the budget deal
Let me just say that budget is going to get passed on Monday Paterson said
And Ive heard people talking about being here July numth
If theyd like to be here July numth they can come by the mansion
We have a nice fireworks demonstration every year
They can come and watch it but there will be no discussion of budget on July numth because it will have already been addressed on June numth
Legislative leaders said they continue to work toward an agreement before Monday
Eating a healthy diet may be good for you but it may be unintentionally slimming for the economies of some developing countries a new study says
British researchers modeled what could happen if people in Britain and Brazil adopted healthier diets as defined by the World Health Organization including more fruits and vegetables and less meat and dairy products
In Britain experts estimated that fixing the countrys bad eating habits might prevent nearly num people from prematurely dying of dietrelated health problems like heart disease and cancer
It would also theoretically save the health system num billion pounds $num billion every year
In Brazil however the rates of illnesses linked to a poor diet are not as high as in the UK
So Brazilians would get relatively few health benefits while their economy might lose millions
The study was paid for by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and was published online Thursday in the medical journal Lancet
We are not suggesting people not eat a healthy diet said Richard Smith a professor of health system economics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
Were just trying to point out that healthier eating can have unintended consequences
Smith and colleagues said decisions in Brazil and in Western countries to adopt more vegetarian diets could cost the meatdependent Brazilian economy num million reais $num million
In an ideal world we would all have a perfect diet Smith said
But its also desirable that everybody has a job
Smith said officials should consider nutritional guidelines more carefully
For countries like Brazil which rely heavily on meat imports to the West and to Japan global nutritional advice could potentially be devastating
There are things happening in the rest of the world that this model didnt account for said Julian Morris executive director of International Policy Network a Londonbased think tank
The increasing demand for meat in Asia is substantial ongoing and might counteract any reduced demand in developed countries
Morris also disputed the assumption that healthy eating recommendations would change what people actually do have for dinner
If you really want a dramatic change in consumption of meat and dairy products you need a radical policy like a tax or quota system he said
Robert Beaglehole an emeritus professor at the University of Auckland not linked to the study said scientific developments might help one day
The answer could be to breed healthier cattle and pigs he said adding that more research was needed on whether additional strategies were necessary to ensure healthy eating guidelines dont accidentally hurt developing economies
Smith said experts shouldnt assume nutritional advice even when its followed automatically improves health
You could tell people to buy less meat and maybe they will buy bananas instead he said
But they could also buy more beer and wine
The names can be quirky sublime or romantic
SweeTango Pinata Jazz Aurora Honeycrisp Opal Sweetie Pacific Rose and Ambrosia
Theyre among the most recent apple varieties vying for the attention of consumers and retailers with the hope of bringing growers more money
Ever since the introduction to Washington state of Granny Smith in the nums followed more recently by Fuji Gala Braeburn Jonagold and others to expand the apple market beyond Red and Golden Delicious the search has been on for new apples that emphasize taste
We have to stay current and we have to be consumerdriven said Jim Hazen business manager for Prescott Wash based Broetje Orchards which is handling Sweetie and Opal
Along with the new apples come new marketing strategies
Establishing trademarked names and licensing agreements for the new varieties can limit production and target distribution which can mean higher prices and better quality control
In theory the more exclusive the availability the greater the cachet and the higher the price
Some newer varieties for example are selling at more than twice the price of the old standards such as Red Delicious
The trend which began several years ago when the Pink Lady variety was trademarked represents a significant change in the industry
The days of socalled new open varieties
such as Red and Golden Delicious which could be purchased and grown by orchardists without restriction
now appear to be numbered
The Honeycrisp which was trademarked following its development by the University of Minnesota breeding program shows what a new variety can mean
Since its patent expired two years ago more acres of Honeycrisp have been planted and the varietys popularity and return to growers are touted as a success story
This marketing season average price for a numpound box of Honeycrisp exceeds $num
By comparison Red Delicious the industry mainstay for years is averaging less than $num per box in limited shipments of fruit from the num crop
While the price is high the Honeycrisp variety is difficult to grow and is more susceptible to problems that limit how many are ultimately shipped to market
Other new varieties are in such limited quantities and are being marketed by individual shippers that price information is not available
Another University of Minnesota apple variety SweeTango is being handled as a managed variety meaning production is limited
The name is trademarked and the university has licensed the variety to a select group of growers including some in Washington state
But some disgruntled Minnesota growers not included in the licensing deal are suing
Broetje Orchards and its marketing arm FirstFruits Marketing are providing the Sweetie variety exclusively to Top Food Drug and Haggen Food and Pharmacy in Washington and Oregon
The apples which went on sale late last month are promoted as having a beautiful red color accented by golden cheeks
An initial retail price was $num per pound
Other warehouse and marketing firms have their own varieties
One Stemilt Growers of Wenatchee trademarked the name Pinata and has exclusive rights to grow and market the variety in the United States
The variety was developed in Germany and released throughout Europe in num according to information from Stemilt
Less than num boxes of Pinata made their way to market through June
It becomes a method for all of us to have a special variety to capture a premium that has controlled amounts of volume so it isnt overplanted and supports a higher dollar figure said Roger Pepperl marketing director for Stemilt
Certainly that is what retailers are looking for
Desmond ORourke a retired Washington State University agricultural economist who now operates Belrose Inc which analyzes the world apple market said retailers want to be the exclusive provider to set them apart from their competitors
Retailers are looking for new varieties
In this latest phase retailers are looking for an apple that is special to them he said
Another common trait among these new varieties is they originated someplace else
But that too is changing
Washington state has its own new variety
Technically the variety now known only as WA num was developed by Washington State University breeder Bruce Barritt in conjunction with the Washington State Tree Fruit Research Commission
WA num a blush red apple is undergoing evaluation in commercial orchard settings and is expected to be released in January
Another variety WA num also is in the pipeline
Kate Evans who succeeded Barritt when he retired said the breeding program is an effort to develop an apple suited to the Washington climate
Theres always an interest in new varieties
Growers within the state have been getting varieties in from other places
There is an interest in what they can produce if they are using varieties selected within their own environment
Jim McFerson manager of the research commission said WA num apples picked from four orchards located in Prosser Mattawa Quincy and Brewster are now being evaluated in storage
The research commission is contributing $num a year in grower assessment dollars to support breeding research
Once released Washington growers who pay assessments to the commission will be able to buy the trees that produce the variety
WA num still needs a name and its reception in the market will be the true test
Thats the gamble all the new varieties are facing in this highstakes game that will see some succeed and some fall away
Theres a lot of good news coming for the apple industry in general
Most of it is built around having a better eating experience and creating sustainability for growers Stemilts Pepperl said
Theres a lot of blue sky but there will be some mistakes

The Western Athletic Conference has filed a lawsuit to force Nevada and Fresno State to stay in the league through the num school year before leaving for the Mountain West Conference
WAC commissioner Karl Benson said Tuesday on a conference call that the league filed a complaint last week in Jefferson County District Court in Colorado
The damages the WAC could incur if Fresno State and Nevada left early are very very significant Benson said
Thats what has driven this to protect the assets of the WAC as a corporate entity
Benson said WAC bylaws state members must inform the conference it is leaving for another league by July num or that departing member is obligated to stay through the next two school years
Nevada and Fresno State announced they had accepted invitations to the MWC on July num and both have indicated they would like to leave the WAC and be in their new conference for the num football season
Benson said he has contacted the leaders of Nevada and Fresno State seeking assurances that they will remain in the WAC through June num num
But those assurances have not come he said
I thought the filing of the complaint would initiate some discussion Benson said
But Nevada and Fresno State have still not contacted the commissioner Benson said
The WAC also expects Nevada and Fresno State to pay a $num million exit fee
Benson said the fee is not mentioned in the lawsuit and is a separate issue
Boise State accepted an invitation from the Mountain West Conference in early June and will leave the WAC after this season
After Broncos announced they would leave the WACs other members
including Nevada and Fresno State
voted to implement the steep exit fee to protect the conference from further defections
The other members of the WAC are Hawaii Idaho Utah State Louisiana Tech San Jose State and New Mexico State
Benson said he expects the WAC to remain an eightteam conference in the num season
He has said it is highly unlikely the WAC would be able to have new members in place before the num football season
Weve declared pretty consistently that the football schedule for num would be drastically challenging for the remaining members if they lost two football games less than a year away Benson said
He added the early departure of Nevada and Fresno State would also damage contractual agreements the WAC has with bowl games and ESPN

The number of Utahns filing for bankruptcy during the first nine months of num soared num percent from the same period last year outpacing the US gain of num percent
The Salt Lake Tribune reports that num Utahns and num million Americans have filed for bankruptcy so far this year in a sign that families continue to struggle in an ailing economy
David Sime clerk of the US Bankruptcy Court for Utah said the latest state numbers reflect a continuation of the upward trend in bankruptcy numbers seen over the last several years
Brent Hatch of the Family Financial Education Foundation
an Evanston Wyobased counseling service that advises consumers in Utah and other states
said some people have credit debt and others are struggling to keep homes
And about half those that we are seeing have medical debts that they are unable to pay Hatch told the Tribune
We are seeing people who desperately want to pay their debt but have found themselves in financial trouble
Bankruptcy is viewed as a lagging economic indicator because filings reflect what happened to personal finances one to two years ago
That helps explain why Utahs bankruptcy rate this year has risen at a faster clip than the national rate said Jeff Thredgold economic consultant to Zions Bank
Utah was a little late in entering the national recession so you would expect that we would be seeing higher levels of bankruptcy filings a little later than the rest of the country he said
Of Utahns who have filed for bankruptcy this year num percent sought relief under Chapter num which involves a trustee liquidating a debtors assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors
Any remaining debts are wiped out and the debtor gets a fresh start
The remaining num percent sought Chapter num bankruptcy which allows consumers to formulate a plan to repay all or at least part of what they owe over a period of time
Sam Gerdano executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute said filings nationwide for the first three quarters of num mark the highest total since num when Congress passed sweeping bankruptcy laws

A Pennsylvania judge halted the bidding process Tuesday for a construction project to expand Graterford State Prison siding with contractors whose lawsuit said streamlined procedures violated state law
Commonwealth Court Judge Dan Pellegrini issued a preliminary injunction against the Department of General Services and the Corrections Department over the $num million project
Budgetary concerns or expediency do not give the department the right to ignore a legislative mandate Pellegrini wrote
While granting a preliminary injunction may result in prisoners staying out of state a little longer albeit at no additional net cost to the commonwealth it will harm the public more if we allow the department to willfully violate the law
The project is designed to add about num beds to the prison in the Philadelphia suburbs but it will also result in the closure of the original facility and loss of its num beds
Pennsylvania with a booming prison population houses about num inmates at prisons in Michigan and Virginia
The next step will be up to the state said Diane M Tokarsky a lawyer for the contractors and related parties who sue
The judge has advised them where he finds it to be illegal and they would have to cure those illegalities Tokarsky said
She said the case involved three issues whether the Department of General Services could limit the bidding to three bidders whether it should have posted bidders technical details on the Internet and whether the state must obtain separate bids for heating and air conditioning plumbing and electrical work
Corrections spokeswoman Sue Bensinger said the court ruling is under internal legal review
Obviously this is an important project for the DOC to deal with our prison overcrowding so at this point we are looking at the impact the ruling will have on our agency she said
At a news conference Wednesday on another topic Gov
Ed Rendell expressed his disappointment because a we need the prison and b we need the construction jobs

In a report Tuesday Inspector General Joseph Fisch said the findings about Peter Cappuccilli Jr are being forwarded to Attorney General Andrew Cuomo for possible criminal charges including grand larceny and records tampering
Cappuccilli a former Republican Party official appointed fair director in num by Gov
George Pataki said in a statement he will respond at the appropriate time
He wants to explain and defend his reputation and character but has been assured by his lawyer they will have that opportunity he said
I ask that everyone reserve judgment until that time he said
The report said Cappuccilli declined to be interviewed and his lawyer advised that if subpoenaed he would assert his Fifth Amendment right against selfincrimination
Messages left for attorney William Dreyer were not immediately returned
Mr Cappuccilli treated state coffers like his own then falsified or discarded invoices to cover his misdeeds Fisch said
This was flagrant chronic abuse
Cappuccilli a numyearold Syracuse real estate developer was Patakis campaign coordinator for Onondaga and Madison counties during his first run for governor
He was director of the state fair from num until he stepped down in late num
The fair which began in num usually runs for num days starting in late August on the numacre fairgrounds in the Syracuse suburb of Geddes
The fairgrounds have a numseat grandstand and num major exhibit buildings and generate annual revenue of more than $num million with nearly num million visitors
The grounds have num fulltime staff hiring some num parttimers for the fair and have yearround events like concerts and trade shows
The investigation began in num following an audit
Investigators said misconduct by Cappuccilli who had an annual salary of about $num was mainly connected to his relationship with the owners of Catering with a Flair a catering service on the fairgrounds run by longtime friends
According to the report the caterers were required to make $num in improvements to banquet rooms and other leased space but under Cappuccillis direction in num that was never enforced
Instead the state spent more than $num for the improvements
For several years the caterers put on holiday parties costing about $num each but charged the state only about $num submitting bills only for the gratuity
They also catered wedding receptions in num and num for Cappuccillis daughters at the fairgrounds the latter cost more than $num but the brides father was charged only $num the report said
The report also said nepotism and cronyism were rampant under Cappuccillis tenure with his and other staffs friends and family being hired for more than $num
Investigators said Cappuccilli hired his friend Timothy Kuhl in num as a sales consultant and later manager
Kuhl was paid $num in num after he relocated for a fulltime job in North Carolina with the National Hockey Leagues Carolina Hurricanes
While Kuhl said he continued to oversee the sales department from afar other fair sales employees said they were unaware he was still employed after he left the report said
Investigators said that from num to num $num worth of free reviewer concert tickets were given to state police assigned to the fair as a perk with an additional $num worth given to fair employees from num to num along with free parking passes and fair admission tickets for family members
In num alone num reviewer tickets were issued altogether for num shows
That has largely ceased under current management with only three free tickets per show for reviewers the report said
However some other problems have cropped up
Investigators noted a solesource contract for a boxing show last year with Rhode Islandbased Classic Entertainment and Sports Inc costing $num
Only num fans showed up for the show which generated $num in revenue
The planned boxing event for num has been canceled
The Kroger Co the countrys largest grocery store chain said Thursday it will buy back $num million in shares
The plan replaces the $num million remaining under its previous $num billion repurchase program begun in January num
Kroger plans to use free cash flow to buy back shares pay dividends to shareholders and keep up its current debt rating
Since num Kroger said it has reduced debt by $num billion

Shares of Kroger were unchanged at $num during afternoon trading
Life insurer Lincoln National Corp on Wednesday said it has repaid in full the $num million in federal government bailout aid that it received last year
Lincoln National said it used proceeds from stock and debt offerings to buy back all the preferred shares issued to the US Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program part of the governments Troubled Asset Relief Program
Lincoln National which markets itself as Lincoln Financial Group said on June num that it would sell $num million of common stock and up to $num million in senior notes so that it could exit the program
At the height of the financial crisis in fall num the government committed $num billion of taxpayer funds to help financial services companies
Hundreds of US banks and insurance companies participated and received cash investments from the Treasury Department in exchange for preferred stock
Shares of Lincoln National rose num cents to $num in afternoon trading

Andrew Sipple imagined such things as a young boy when he would listen to the birds and watch the clouds float by while sitting in his mothers small garden
He began creating them at num when flush with knowledge gleaned from botany texts and field guides he set off to expand the gardens and fill them with an array of plants and flowers
Sipple now num and heading into his senior year at Saegertown High School has since transformed his familys numacre property off Route num in Hayfield Township into a botanical wonderland
It features big and brilliant flower gardens designed in the style of three major art movements
It holds two miles of walking trails that travel through woods fields and marshy areas
It contains rows of day lilies hosta and other plant varieties that Sipple grows and sells to support his pursuits at the place he calls Natures Serenity Botanical Gardens and Park
Sipple has thrown himself into his work spending long summer days tending to the grounds and searching far and wide for new plants to add to his collection
I always wanted to be active
I wanted to get in there and put the flowers in
For years I didnt want to weed didnt want to do that hard job he said
But by the time I turned num I became very serious about gardening
And now I must admit weeding is my favorite thing to do
Sipple loses track of time when hes out in his gardens as he typically starts his day at about num am and regularly works well beyond his desired quitting time of num pm
People diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome a mild form of autism that Sipple was diagnosed with as a child tend to have trouble with time management he said
They also tend to have trouble socializing with others Sipple said
But Sipple and his father Milton Sipple both said he has overcome his socialization issues
Thats evident in the tours of Serenity Gardens that Sipple has offered to the public since midMay
The tours available every Saturday and on Mondays and Wednesdays during the summer months feature detailed information about the history of the project and everything growing in Andrew Sipples beds
What stands out most in those visits however is Andrew Sipples knowledge of and passion for gardening
I love plants either cultivating them or looking at them in the wild he said during a recent tour
Andrew Sipple then paused to survey a brilliant red flower in a pot in his sale area
One of my favorites monarda didyma bee balm attracts hummingbirds he said
The highlights of the tours are Sipples three main gardens
Each one is like an art composition sort of like a painting
But you can walk through it he said
The Impression Garden which Andrew Sipple built over six years by expanding his mothers original garden taps into the impressionism art form by featuring a breathtaking blur of color and blooms during spring when most of the gardens flowers bloom he said
There are tulips daffodils and bleeding hearts and lupine that shoots up through forgetmenots that spill across the walking paths
If you come during May you can actually see the representation he said
That garden doesnt really carry that name the rest of the year
I just keep it cleaned up
The Romantic Garden which was carved out of a grassy area of his yard beginning in April num is very full and very intense with plants very expressive Andrew Sipple said
Day lilies coneflowers and other colorful blooms line a narrow grasscovered labyrinth that leads to a large rock in the center of the garden where visitors are invited to sit and meditate
The Classical Garden stands in contrast to the Romantic Garden as it features a square courtyard beds set in perfect angles and plantings that are balanced in all but one of the beds
The garden also features benches a birdbath and statues including one of Athena the Greek goddess of wisdom
Wisdom is something that I value Andrew Sipple said
Andrew Sipple has many more plans for his botanical gardens
He wants to extend the existing gardens to take advantage of hydrangeas that grow near the house and he envisions a patio area with tables and chairs under a large apple tree beyond the Classical Garden
Andrew Sipple is also planning to add new nature gardens
Two will be designed to attract birds and butterflies and a third will be devoted to wildflowers he said
Id like to have a nice walkthrough park and would also like to feature even more plants he said
Im hoping to have enough of an enterprise so I can open a small garden shop in an adjacent building and sell photographs of my gardens

Illinois officials are encouraging shoppers to patronize the states small businesses on Saturday after Thanksgiving
Economic development officials say Small Business Saturday is sandwiched nicely between Black Friday and Cyber Monday traditionally two of the years busiest shopping days
There are more than num small businesses retailers and merchants in Illinois
The Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity is teaming with American Express on the promotion
The federal government says the nations num million small businesses created num percent of new jobs
DCEO Director Warren Ribley says if every small business in the state could add one job the unemployment rate would drop five points
Illinois has a $num tax credit for each job created at businesses with num or fewer employers before June num
The Pennsylvania gaming board has postponed until next month a decision on whether to revoke the license of a planned casino in South Philadelphia
The state Gaming Control Board decided Wednesday to put off a decision until Nov num after Foxwoods Casino investors announced a deal with Harrahs Entertainment
Chairman Gregory Fajt fite says commissioners recognize that investors have a new plan but the board will still consider stripping the project of its license
The longstalled riverfront project has faced financial troubles and neighborhood opposition since winning one of two gambling licenses set aside for Philadelphia in num
But Fajt says other casino licensees have overcome some or all of the same problems
and Foxwoods is further away from putting a shovel in the ground now than it was four years ago
The European Central Bank is expected to leave its key interest rate at num percent on Thursday as its governing council holds its first monetary policy meeting since last months decision to buy government bonds to ease the debt crisis
the euro recently hit a series of fouryear lows to trade below $num this week
attention will turn to the press conference President JeanClaude Trichet holds after the policy meeting
Investors will want to hear what Trichet says about the program to buy government bonds to support and boost confidence in the European government debt market
specifically whether it will continue and for how long
Depending on how they are done bond purchases by a central bank can increase the supply of money in the economy which can both stimulate growth and cause inflation undercutting the future value of the euro
Trichet has said the banks bond move would not stoke inflation because it sterilizes its interventions
that is it offsets the impact on money supply by other means
Socalled quantitative easing which the Bank of England is doing aims to increase the amount of money in an economy to make credit more available
The program should not be confused with quantitative easing
In simple words We are not printing money Trichet has said
Still the purchases are not unanimously supported by governing council members
Italian Central Bank governor Mario Draghi has said the market intervention will have to be discontinued as quickly as possible while German Bundesbank governor Axel Weber said it is essential that possible supportive measures be strictly targeted and tightly controlled
Immediate fears of default have been averted by the European Union and International Monetary Funds euronum billion $num billion package of cash and state loan guarantees to protect debtladen countries in the numnation eurozone from bankruptcy
However the impact of painful austerity measures on growth in future years has weighed on the euro and raised worries of a doubledip recession
Europes leaders say the euro rescue package must be backed up with drastic austerity measures to get debt under control
and shore up credibility in the fundamental rules that govern their numyearold currency
Trichet has said Europe needs the equivalent of a budgetary federation as a watchdog over eurozone governments public finances
Also weighing on the euro have been predictions that the bank will wait well into num before raising its key interest rate from the current record low of num percent
Those low rates can weigh on the euros exchange rate by reducing return on eurodenominated investments
especially if rates go up first in the United States as its economy recovers
Mamadou Niass is consumed by thoughts of a home he has not set foot in for nearly num years
In the village of Sorimiale in Mauritania Africa about num people including Niass family and friends live in squalor in a country torn by civil war and oppressive governments
Niass who sought political asylum in the United States and moved to Steamboat Springs nine years ago has been sending family and friends most of his paychecks from his job at a lumberyard
However after he was laid off he decided to find another outlet for his hardworking nature
All Im thinking about is home family he said
Sometimes I cant eat Im thinking about my family
Thats why Im thinking about this
This week Niass will pack an enormous Africabound shipping container full of donated items for his village
With the help of Luther Berntson a friend Niass collected the items and the money needed from people in the community a process Berntson said has been rewarding
I think when he came to me and told me about this project I said Mamadou do you know what youre getting into
But Ive seen him work and Im so amazed and so impressed with what hes doing for his people
Hes a hard worker and hes very strong
Niass was a member of the military in Mauritania before a change in the countrys leadership caused him to be thrown in prison in num
He said he was accused of trying to overthrow the government and it wouldnt be safe for him to remain in the country after he was let out of prison
He escaped to neighboring Senegal then to the Ivory Coast where he lived for nine years
But turmoil in Ivory Coast forced him to sneak back across the border into Mauritania in the dead of night looking for a visa to travel to the United States
The government was on his heels he said when he left his home for the last time
Its not safe for me there he said
If they would have trouble they look at old military guys
A network of Mauritanians living in the United States led him to Steamboat Springs where Berntson and a support group of residents helped outfit a group of about num Mauritanians who arrived in num
Niass and Berntsons friendship lasted and has only solidified through their common goal of helping the people of Sorimiale
But loading the shipping container is too big a job for the two of them
Berntson and Niass are looking for help in packing the container and still are accepting cash donations to help pay for the cost of shipping which amounts to about $num
As far as donated items Niass was proud to say he has enough for this shipment but after the response from the community he plans to send another when he has the money
In Berntsons garage on Aug num where he was putting the final strips of tape on several boxes Niass proudly pointed out about num mattresses hed be sending over
He said his village people had never slept on anything like them before
They will be very very happy he said
But if they find clothes for free see they cannot buy clothes
The boxes were packed with everything from toys and electronics to books in French
one of Mauritanias official languages
donated by the Steamboat Springs School District
Niass also received hundreds of pairs of shoes and several soccer balls
I cant help my people anymore because I dont have money he said
I used to bring money but I cant anymore
Now Im asking people for things
All that is because of Luther
All that is because he gives me his truck
He will call me and say Mamadou Ive got something for you
Aside from cleaning houses a few days a week Niass has made his donation project his fulltime job even while fasting during daylight hours through the Muslim month of Ramadan which lasts through Sept num
He occasionally visits his immediate family including his wife and seven children in Senegal where they moved for their own safety
But his presence will be felt in Sorimiale when the shipping container arrives bestowing his brothers sisters nieces nephews cousins and friends with basic comforts and well wishes from across the globe
They feel good about that he said about his living situation even though its so far from his loved ones
I like it so much here
I like Steamboat very nice people
I have a lot of friends here
Almost it is my home
Before picking up any Wii games or downloading apps on her iPhone for her two daughters Lillian Quintero does her homework
Shell first read reviews online and in magazines then try them out for herself
If she thinks the games are engaging and educational enough numyearold Isabella and numyearold Sophia are free to play
I know theres going to be a point where they get these things on their own said the numyearold mother from Long Beach California
Were not going to be there to monitor everything
Thats why the most important thing is communication instilling morals and values in them and helping them to understand certain boundaries
Theres only so much you can do
Quintero and her husband Jorge are some of the parents who support a California law that seeks to ban the sale and rental of violent games to children
The law which has bounced around the legal system like a game of Pong since Gov
Arnold Schwarzenegger first signed it in num was declared unconstitutional last year by the numth US
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
The US Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday about the federal courts decision to throw out Californias ban on violent games marking the first time a case involving the interactive medium itself has gone before the Supreme Court
Its another sign that the $num billionayear industry long considered to be just childs play is now all grown up
Californias measure would have regulated games more like pornography than movies prohibiting the sale or rental of games that give players the option of killing maiming dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being to anyone under the age of num
Only retailers would be punished with fines of up to $num for each infraction
The federal court said the law violated minors constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth amendments and the state lacked enough evidence to prove violent games cause physical and psychological harm to minors
Courts in six other states including Michigan and Illinois have reached similar conclusions striking down parallel violent game bans
Under Californias law only adults would be able to purchase games like Postal num the firstperson shooter by developer Running With Scissors that features the ability to light unarmed bystanders on fire and Grand Theft Auto IV the popular thirdperson shootemup from Rockstar Games that allows gamers to portray carjacking guntoting gangsters
The Quinteros like most supporters believe the law will protect children from buying such violent titles while gamers and free speech advocates think Californias ban could lead to strict federal regulation on the content of games and other media
All agree however that the graphically rich medium has come a long way from numbit tennis matches
The average age of gamers is num according to the Entertainment Software Association and many are paying close attention to the Supreme Court case
The Entertainment Consumers Association which lobbies on behalf of gamers is organizing a rally outside the Supreme Court building Tuesday as a way of sending a strong message and uniting gamers
Its not so much a video game case as a First Amendment case said George Rose chief public policy officer at Activision Blizzard Inc the Santa Monica Californiabased publisher of the popular Call of Duty and Guitar Hero gaming franchises
The gamemaker filed a friendofthecourt brief opposing Californias ban which was never enforced
Other allies in the fight include Xbox manufacturer Microsoft Corp Star Wars publisher LucasArts The Recording Academy Motion Picture Association of America as well as the Entertainment Merchants Association and Entertainment Software Association which sued to block Californias ban calling it unnecessary unwarranted and unconstitutional
Opponents of the ban have called the measure unnecessary because virtually all major game publishers and retailers employ a universal voluntary rating system much like movie studios and theaters that assigns one of eight agespecific ratings to games then blocks the sale of games that are rated M for mature and AO for adults only to children
The gaming industry has actually done a better job of preventing minors from buying entertainment not intended for their age group than the music and film industries according to the Federal Trade Commission
In a report released last year the FTC found that num percent of minors were able to buy Mrated games down from num percent three years earlier
In contrast num percent of minors were able buy music CDs with explicit content warnings num percent were sold Rrated and unrated DVDs and num percent purchased tickets to Rrated movies
The FTC noted there were gaps in enforcement of agebased sales restrictions specifically with the use of gift cards in online purchases and unrestricted mobile games
The Parents Television Council which supports Californias ban on violent games conducted its own secret shopper campaign this year with children between the ages of num and num attempting to buy Mrated games at num stores in num states
The group found num instances of retailers including Target Kmart Sears and Best Buy selling Mrated games to minors
Leland Yee the Democratic state senator and child psychologist who originally authored the law contends the gaming industrys rating system is not effective because of the sweeping scope of games which are longer and more intricate than movies
Yee said he believes violent games are more harmful to children because of the mediums interactive nature
This isnt an attack on the First Amendment said Yee
Im a supporter of the First Amendment
This is about not making ultra violent video games available to children
Within the bill the definition of a violent video game is so narrowly tailored because of my respect for the First Amendment
This isnt to stop the creation of violent video games
Yees position hasnt stopped the Entertainment Software Associations Video Game Voters Network from targeting him
The group has asked gamers to write I believe in the First Amendment on old or broken controllers and send them to Yee
When asked about the joystick campaign the senator scoffed and said that any gifts he received would be returned
The Quinteros who practice yoga poses in their living room during rounds of Wii Fit wont be sending their Wii Balance Board to Yee
While they believe its ultimately up to parents to police what games their children play Lillian and Jorge agree that they would feel more comfortable if violent games were legally off limits from being sold to kids
Its one less way for children to have access to it said Jorge a numyearold middle school teacher who recently bought an iPad
You dont pick a weenie off the grill with your hands because you know your hand will get burned
We shouldnt let children buy something violent that they dont think will affect them

The incoming chairman of the Ohio Senates finance committee says the hole in the next state budget could be as high as $num billion nearly $num billion higher that what has been estimated
Much has been discussed about roughly $num billion in onetime grants and other money used to balance the current twoyear budget that wont be there in future years
But Republican Sen Chris Widener of Springfield tells The Cleveland Plain Dealer for a Saturday report that the problem will likely go beyond that
There is also a series of other things swirling around out there impacting our budget above and beyond onetime money
We have other expenditures we are committed and obligated to make he said
Among them he said are Medicaid growth that could exceed $num billion and a $num million interest payment owed the federal government for borrowing to for the state unemployment compensation fund
There are probably num to num things that are going to come to roost one way or another positive or negative to have an impact on the next state budget Widener said
Ohio has a new governor Republican John Kasich taking office Jan num
By midMarch he must have a blueprint for balancing the $num billionplus budget for the upcoming twoyear period
He has said he wants to cut taxes and phase out the states income tax
To trim costs he has proposed diverting nonviolent offenders from prisons and taking on public employee unions
The administration of outgoing Gov
Ted Strickland a Democrat hasnt made budget projections since last year but revenues are higher than expected said spokeswoman Allison Kolodziej
Office of Budget and Management number show personal income tax collections were up num percent and sales tax collections also increased over a recent threemonth period compared with the same period a year earlier
Kolodziej said any budget projections are speculative until revenue growth and spending levels are determined
Widener isnt optimistic about revenue growth
Its expected to continue to be on the plus side which is a positive note Widener said
But I dont personally think there is going to be any major revenue growth in the next budget

A jury on Thursday convicted three British Muslims of conspiring to murder hundreds of people as part of a plot to blow up passenger planes over the Atlantic
Ibrahim Savant num Arafat Waheed Khan num and Waheed Zaman num were found guilty at Londons Woolwich Crown Court after a threemonth trial
They will be sentenced Monday and face life imprisonment
Prosecutors say the men were part of a group that planned to detonate liquid explosive bombs hidden in soft drink bottles on aircraft bound for the United States and Canada in num an attack that could have killed people on the scale of the Sept num attacks
The plot was broken up when suspects were scooped up in raids in London and the surrounding area in August num
The foiled attack grounded hundreds of flights and changed air travel for good as airline authorities to put strict restrictions on the quantity of liquids passengers can carry in their luggage
limits that remain in place
It has taken four years to bring all the accused to justice
This was the third trial of the three defendants
Two earlier juries failed to reach verdicts on charges of conspiracy to murder
They were acquitted at an earlier trial of knowing that airplanes were the plots target but prosecutors said they had prepared to become suicide bombers and recorded martyrdom videos
The men had argued that the videos were part of an elaborate publicity stunt
Prosecutor Sue Hemming said the trio were involved in a calculated and sophisticated plot to create a terrorist event of major proportions working alongside others who were determined to bring down aircraft using homemade explosives causing the maximum possible loss of life
They were cleared in the previous trial of being aware of the ultimate targets of the plot but we say that they were committed to the principle and practice of violent jihad to the point of targeting innocent people in an attempt to further their cause
Three other men described as the groups ringleaders are serving long sentences for the plot
Home Secretary Theresa May said the men had been convicted of one of the most significant terrorist plots the UK has ever seen
Making its second attempt after being grounded Wednesday by high winds a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket rumbled into the blue sky and wispy white clouds at num am sending ripples through the clouds as it reached supersonic speeds on an eastward arc over the Atlantic Ocean
Nearly two hours later the numpound satellite called SDO separated from the rockets Centaur upper stage and spread out its solar arrays beginning a life in space expected to last five to num years
It was really pretty spectacular said Madhulika Guhathakurta SDO program scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington DC We were all really eager to see this take off
The launch had been delayed from num because of spacecraft problems and then a wait for a launch vehicle
From a perch num miles above Earth SDOs three science instruments will soon begin shooting pictures of the sun and recording sound waves and radiation all more rapidly and in better resolution than ever before
The goal is to understand the physics behind the formation of the suns magnetic field and explosions of energy and matter that can influence Earths atmosphere and electronic systems
Solar flares and other space weather can disrupt communications systems cause power outages and damage satellites
Scientists hope to more accurately predict those events
Theres so much in the sun that we do understand but theres so much we dont understand said Tom Woods of the University of Colorado the principal investigator for an instrument that will measure extreme ultraviolet radiation
We have good measurements today but these are going to be outstanding really surpassing everything weve done in the past
The quality of the satellites pictures are said to be num times better than highdefinition TV and the quantity of data continuously beamed to a New Mexico ground station equivalent to downloading a halfmillion songs daily
Thursdays launch was the first for NASAs Living With a Star program which plans to operate four spacecraft by num

Never before have so many US governorships been up for grabs
and with so much at stake
The races for state executives come just ahead of onceinadecade congressional and legislative redistricting to reflect the US population of the num census a process in which governors will play a central role
Of the num governorships on the ballot in November more than half are open seats
And many of the contests are in prime num presidential battleground states
Democrats control num of the countrys num state governorships and must defend num in November
Sheer math the sour economy and historical trends favoring the outofpower party in November elections suggest big Republican statehouse gains
We are now tasked with remaking the political map proclaims the website of the Republican Governors Association headed by Mississippi Gov
Haley Barbour a potential presidential candidate
Republicans are hoping for eight or more pickups
We cant wait until num to start taking our country back says Barbour
Democrats are striving to minimize losses and pull off some upsets
We knew it was going to be a tough year just by virtue of the fact that we elected a Democrat to the White House in num said Nathan Daschle executive director of the Democratic Governors Association
History shows the presidents party loses num governors seats in midterm elections
Furthermore the poor economy and growing ultraconservative teaparty activism are weighing on all incumbents and those perceived as establishment candidates
In a year like this no one is safe Daschle said
Underscoring the high stakes The Republican governors association is poised to spend up to $num million on the races its Democratic counterpart about $num million
Republicans best shot for pickups may be a string of governorships now held by Democrats across some upper Midwestern states including Ohio Michigan Wisconsin Illinois and Iowa as well as Pennsylvania
Democrats have fewer opportunities for gains although they appear on track to pick up Republican governorships in Hawaii Connecticut and possibly Minnesota
Both parties were pumping resources into highprofile campaigns in populous California Texas and Florida all won by Republicans four years ago
Democrats hope to add at least one of those big three to their column
These have been particularly trying times for governors
On the front line of the economic crisis many have been forced to cut services or raise taxes
And theyve been bloodied by voter anger and the tea party movement sweeping the nation
Unlike the federal government governors cant print money and many are barred from deficit spending
That along with term limits in some states is why so few sitting governors are running
Only num incumbents are on the ballot
And some standing for reelection are in close races including Democratic Govs
Chet Culver in Iowa Ted Strickland in Ohio Martin OMalley in Maryland even Deval Patrick in Massachusetts
Governors in num of the num states on the ballot will have a pivotal role in redrawing congressional and legislative district lines
Whichever party has more control over the process is likely to get a larger number of favorable districts
Governor jobs have long been known as fertile ground for future presidents and there could some among this years bumper crop of new faces
Four of the past six presidents were governors first
Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan Bill Clinton and George W Bush
Efforts by the US coal industry to expand its export market have taken a significant step forward Tuesday as officials in Washington state approved a plan to ship the fuel to Asia through a Columbia River port
Cowlitz County commissioners voted Tuesday to allow a subsidiary of Australiabased Ambre Energy to redevelop a port near Longview to handle num million tons of coal annually
The project about num miles north of Portland Ore would be the first of several proposed new coal terminals on the West Coast
It would serve mines in Montana and Wyoming where a region known as the Powder River Basin holds some of the largest coal reserves in the world
Several environmental groups want to halt the project
They say it runs counter to efforts by Washington Oregon and other states to curb their own greenhouse gas emissions
and will simply shift those emissions overseas
The commissioners drew a bubble around the project and ignored every effect outside of that bubble said Jan Hasselman a staff attorney with Earthjustice
They ignored the effect of trains coming through Columbia Gorge the effects of increased mining the effects of mercury blowing back from China
Hasselman said environmental groups are considering appealing the permit to the state Shorelines Hearings Board
Cowlitz commissioners on Tuesday approved a shoreline development permit for the project
The countys planning department had concluded there would be no significant environmental impact from the project if certain conditions were met
We had to look at the shorelines permit itself based on legal advice we received said Commissioner Mike Karnofski
There were other issues associated such concerns about greenhouse gases
But that was outside of the parameters of the shorelines permit
Mike Wojtowicz the Cowlitz County building and planning director said the issues that were raised were all mitigated and didnt rise to that level of a fuller environmental impact statement
But Brett VandenHeuvel executive director of the Hood River Orebased Columbia Riverkeeper said the county should have completed a broader environmental analysis
We think exporting millions of tons of coal to China is clearly a significant impact he said
An Ambre subsidiary Millennium Bulk Logistics is handling the project which includes dredging the river to accommodate large vessels and the installation of conveyor belts and other equipment

State agencies have submitted their budget requests for the twoyear budget cycle that begins next year as Nebraska lawmakers face a projected shortfall of hundreds of millions of dollars
The scope of the requests will not be known until sometime next week after analysts have had a chance to study thousands of pages submitted by more than num agencies state budget analyst Lyn Heaton said Friday
But state leaders have made clear that theyre looking for cuts
The latest projections from the Nebraska Department of Revenue show the state facing a possible twoyear budget shortfall of $num million
Dave Heineman and state lawmakers will sift through the agencies requests as they prepare to craft a pennypinching budget that must under state law be approved during next years legislative session
If reelected in November Heineman will submit his budget proposal to lawmakers in January
His Democratic challenger Mike Meister would have until February to submit a budget proposal if he wins the election
This is the beginning of the budget process Heineman spokeswoman Jen Rae Hein said
These are merely proposals that will be evaluated over the coming months
The governor will present a balanced budget without raising taxes in early January
Legislative committees are in the process of identifying possible cuts totaling num percent of state generalfund appropriations for all agencies under their purview
Special attention will be paid to Knum education and Medicaid because both received large amounts of federal stimulus dollars for the current budget cycle that required changes in state law
So for funding to be reduced for each because stimulus money not be available laws will have to be changed
Overall replacing stimulus money is the largest projected increase in the next twoyear budget accounting for more than num percent of the total increase
Historically those agencies claiming the biggest pieces of the state budget pie have been the massive Department of Health and Human Services and education agencies such as the Department of Education and the University of Nebraska
Just how their budgets will shape up remains to be seen
The University of Nebraska budget request alone is more than num pages
which oversees campuses in Lincoln Omaha and Kearney as well as its medical school at Omaha
is seeking an increase of at least $num million over the next two years
And thats assuming an acrosstheboard pay freeze
If the universitys unioncovered faculty were to negotiate a num percent pay raise over the next to years university officials estimate the institution would need an increase of $num million in state funds over the next two years
Because the university facultys bargaining unit hasnt even begun the process of negotiating salaries for the next two years the budget request submitted this week is really a moving target said university spokeswoman Sharon Stephan
Weve got a lot more work to do in the months ahead
But we want the governor and Legislature to maintain education as a priority Stephan said
Officials with the Department of Education did not return calls Friday seeking clarification on that departments numpage budget request but a segment listed under analysis in its initial pages indicated that it would seek an additional $num million in state funds for num
a more than num percent increase from the current year
The states Knum public education system prospered in the current budget cycle with $num million in federal stimulus money
but that money dries up after num
The Department of Health and Human Services is seeking an increase in aid funding from the state of nearly $num million
about a num percent jump
over the next two years
However the agency is seeking more than $num million less in operating funds from the state over the next two years a drop of more than num percent
The Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board is set to meet Oct num to project total state tax revenues for the fiscal years num and num
That boards projections could lead to a number of adjustments as agencies and lawmakers attempt to craft the next twoyear budget said state budget director Gerry Oligmueller
Those will become the numbers upon which the budgets are crunched Oligmueller said
More Americans say they moved because they were evicted or wanted to spend less money and now live in a worse house with more people new Census data show
The num American Housing Survey shows the stark effect the recession and housing crisis have had on some peoples lifestyles in just two years
The survey last conducted in num captures the brunt of the downturns impact on housing
It seems to mark some erosion in the standard of living of Americans says James Hughes dean of the Edward J Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University
Its not surprising given the depths of the recession
Some portions of Americans are now in survival mode
In num when the USA suffered the worst job losses since statistics were created num million jobs vanished
Thats a lot of housing buying power that disappeared Hughes says
The Census survey is based on a sample of about num housing units num of them occupied
The number of households that moved in the past year because they were evicted soared num percent to num
num million households or num percent of those who moved in the past year said theyre in a worse home up num percent from num num million or num percent said theyre in a worse neighborhood a num percent increase
Its a reduction of the American Dream says Robert Lang urban sociologist at the University of NevadaLas Vegas
In num num percent of households that moved did so for a better home and num percent moved for lower rent or maintenance
In num only num percent moved to upgrade num percent moved to reduce costs
Large households with five or more people inched up to num million or num percent of occupied houses and homes shared by two families grew slightly to num million
The number of homes that are coowned or corented went up num percent to num million
The number of households that had more people move in went up num percent to num million
Some of this is immigration Lang says
Some is the boomerang kid who wouldve gotten an apartment but stays at home because of the economy and high unemployment
More worked from home an num percent jump from num
They dont need a formal office Lang says
All you need is a kitchen table and an iPad
The number of homes that are num square feet or larger dropped num percent
Its come down no question says Stephen Melman director of economic services at the National Association of Home Builders
The groups consumer confidence survey shows that buyers are cautious and practical
Maybe when we have the choice well go to one less bedroom one less bathroom Melman says
They view housing as shelter
Its really back to the basics
The share of homes with central air conditioning has caught up with the share of homes with dishwashers num percent
That shows how big the shift to the Sun Belt has been Lang says
Parts of the United States are unlivable without air conditioning
You can live in Phoenix without a dishwasher
Try living in Phoenix without air conditioning
Home construction is expected to have slowed down in May after a key tax incentive expired
Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters are predicting that housing construction fell num percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of num in May
Thats down from Aprils figure of num the highest level in num months
The Commerce Department will release the report at num am EDT Wednesday
The report also is expected to show that applications for new building permits considered a good sign of future activity will increase to an annual rate of num in May
Thats up from Aprils level of num
In a typical economic recovery the construction sector provides much of the fuel
But that hasnt happened this time largely because developers are trying to sell a glut of homes built during the boom years and must compete against foreclosed homes selling at deep discounts
Homebuilders are feeling less confident in the recovery now that government incentives for buyers have expired
The National Association of Home Builders said Tuesday its housing market index fell to num in June sinking five points after two straight months of increases
It was the lowest level since March
Builders had been more optimistic earlier in the year when buyers could take advantage of tax credits of up to $num
Those incentives expired on April num although buyers with signed contracts have until June num to complete their purchases
Experts anticipate home sales will slow in the second half of this year
In addition high unemployment and tight mortgage lending continue to keep many buyers on the sidelines
Well before the brutal peak of this weeks East Coast heat wave utility managers watched as overwhelmed circuits in New York shut down one by one
Hundreds of homes in Queens went dark
The city turned to a wholesale power market upstate to buy extra energy at peak prices to keep the air conditioners humming
By the end of the day all but about num of Consolidated Edisons num million customers still had power
The balancing act has played out up and down the East Coast during a vicious stretch of hot weather that has presented the electricity grid with one of its toughest tests since a massive blackout in num
For the most part it has held up
I cant sit here and say theres never going to be another blackout said Gerry W Cauley president of the North American Electric Reliability Corp But were much better prepared
Utilities and regulators credit reforms and upgrades put in place after the num outage which left tens of millions of people without power in the Northeast and parts of Canada
The corporation authorized by the government three years ago to regulate the grid enforces national guidelines for training utility managers clearing vegetation from lines and using technology to keep blackouts from happening again
It wields a big stick
Rules considered voluntary before the blackout are now backed by NERC fines that can add up to $num million per day
Regional power grids also have started talking to each other more
A USCanadian task force blamed the num blackout in part on poor coordination between regional agencies that allowed power failures to spread
PJM Interconnection a Pennsylvania company that manages one of the largest power grids in the world has invested nearly $num billion over the past decade to improve its network
It works with neighboring grids in the Midwest and Tennessee Valley
And its control room now features more detailed displays that help operators decide where to send power
If you can see something out a little farther and see something coming PJM spokesman Ray Dotter said the more time you have to respond
The blackout in August num wasnt triggered by high temperatures or heavy demand
A task force later discovered that it began as overgrown trees damaged transmission lines in Ohio
The drop in voltage quickly spread to surrounding networks taking just minutes to put vast swaths of the Midwest and Northeast in the dark
The power was shut off for days causing as much as $num billion in damage to the US economy
Since then NERC policies have forced utilities to train staff to know how to use their equipment and identify power failures
Its handed down roughly num penalties for violating safety standards and once NERC identifies a problem affecting power transmission in one region it sends out alerts to grid operators in the rest of the country
Midwestern utilities also benefit from a sort of air traffic control system for power the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator
Since num the operator has started selling energy to utilities to help them anticipate spikes in demand
New York state has its own independent system operator and when utilities needed more juice on Tuesday as the temperature soared above num degrees in New York City it pumped more onto the grid
The operator headquartered near Albany sells spare electricity on its real time market to power companies throughout the day as needed
On Tuesday realtime prices to New York surged from $num per megawatt hour at num am to $num at num pm
The market represents only a tiny percent of the energy bought on wholesale markets
High demand during a hot summer day makes money for a lot of people including power generators which send their electricity where it is most needed
particularly the powerhungry Northeast said Glenn Williams an analyst for Thestreetcom
The Canadians are making money as they import power Williams said
Theyre not only importing power in through New England but theyre importing power also in New York and also in the Midwest
The system operator for New York doesnt disclose how much energy gets sold on its wholesale markets
But judging from the jump in prices it is clear utilities are digging in for a long hot summer
As temperatures soared energy demand on the grid peaked at num megawatts on Tuesday nearly twice the daily average for the year
It hit num megawatts on Wednesday
The East Coast should see some relief later in the week as cooler air moves inland from the Atlantic forecasters say
Daytime highs should be in the lower nums considerably lower than earlier this week
When temperatures jump again Con Ed will count on hightech sensors in its network that detect and locate faults in the grid allowing the company to patch up problems faster John Miksad the utilitys senior vice president of electric operations
Thats critical on days like today he said
Eventually Con Ed hopes the sensors will help predict weaknesses in the grid before they become a problem
That would allow maintenance crews to repair parts of the grid in the spring well before energy demand spikes in the summer

WalMart Stores Incs chief merchandising officer John Fleming is leaving the company Aug num after num years the worlds largest retailer said Friday
Fleming who played a big role in shaping what was on store shelves will be replaced temporarily by two people Jack Sinclair an executive vice president will oversee food and health and wellness merchandise John Westling another executive vice president will oversee general merchandise and replenishment
A WalMart spokesman said Fleming is leaving to spend more time with his family
The move comes three days after the company based in Bentonville Arkansas said Chief Operating Officer Bill Simon would take over from Eduardo CastroWright as president and CEO of its US operations
CastroWright will lead the retailers ecommerce unit Globalcom and its global sourcing division
He will remain vice chairman of the company
WalMarts CEO Mike Duke said earlier in the week that the shift allows CastroWright to relocate to California to be with his wife following her recent heart transplant
The move will help WalMart focus on growing its international Web retail operations at a faster pace and expand online sales he added
WalMart Stores Inc benefited as consumers traded down during the recession
But now wealthier patrons are showing signs of trading back up and high unemployment and gas prices are still squeezing the retailers main clientele
In May the company posted a num percent increase in firstquarter net income but that was driven by costcutting and growth overseas
A key measure of revenue dropped num percent the fourth consecutive quarter it fell as WalMarts namesake stores saw people shopping less or defecting to rivals such as Target or dollar stores which have heightened their discounting pitch
The economys slowmotion recovery has hurt WalMart but company executives acknowledged to investors in May that a series of merchandising missteps was partly to blame for lackluster revenue results
A weak area has been clothing which the chain has tried to turn around with different strategies
And items like extra varieties of soups or laundry detergent that it stopped carrying when it tried to declutter its stores will be coming back
WalMart is also being more aggressive with price cuts after a year when analysts said the company has been too complacent
Fleming oversaw the chains redirection toward trendier fashion items in num a strategy that flopped
In a note to staffers Simon said WalMarts mandate is to increase customer traffic make sure our products are relevant to our customer and never give an inch on price leadership
Richard Hastings a consumer strategist with Global Hunter Securities said it was unusual to see so much change at the top so quickly and said it suggests that WalMart is looking for new ways to solve its existing problems
The model it had in place was heavily oriented in procurement and logistics Hastings said
This could be a hopeful turning point for WalMart

A group of about num US representatives are the latest to ask BP to stop paying its dividend in the face of massive costs related to the cleanup in and around the Gulf spill
They also asked the company to halt its public relations campaign until the well is capped and the spill has been cleaned up
BP has said it has no intention of cutting its dividend
Shares of other companies tied to the spill moved higher Wednesday as oil prices climbed and the federal government released new rules on drilling in shallow waters

To say that Ed Rehbein and Randy Sanger go with the flow would be an understatement
The two recently published a book chronicling their quest for West Virginias most gorgeous and secluded waterfalls a full num of them collectively titled West Virginia Waterfalls The New River Gorge
When the clouds cover and the rain comes finding the body of water that will recline itself elegantly and powerfully over rock to form a fall is coauthor Sangers compelling narcotic
You pick a creek and follow the water he says
The act often means getting armpit deep without waders or wedging into a crevice just wide enough for shoulders and a tripod
I always have a spare set of clothes and boots with me Sanger says
A lot of what you see is off the radar
Like a fall at Keeneys Creek theres a road right by it but the only way you can see it is to follow the creek
While Rehbein a fine arts photographer writer former pastor and geology major had been photographing waterfalls for numplus years its surprising he didnt wetwalk smack into Sanger a lifelong West Virginia resident who had also been photographing his states natural wonders for double decades
The duo discovered their shared passion for hunting elusive cascades two years ago on Flikr an online photosharing network
It seems genetics may have even played a role in Sangers innate interest
A relative with a penchant for genealogy discovered Daniel Boone is an uncle of mine of some sort he reveals helping to explain his trailblazing tendencies
Carrying a fullcolored hardback waterfall guide suitable for the coffee table on your curious hiking expedition would make as much sense as carrying the coffee table itself
So Rehbein and Sangers publisher Cathy Teets with Headline Books came up with the clever idea of inserting a portable guide to the falls inside the book to assist readers in locating whatever they find that fascinates including meticulous maps by Rehbein
Going where couch potatoes fear to roll Rehbein rates each fall based on efforts in finding from easy to moderate mapping out difficult journeys only for those crazy guys like us who want to go out there and get it
At one waterfall noted in text as Something to Hold on To Rehbein writes The climb was steep and in places a bit treacherous The slopes were so precipitous that I always felt safer if I had something to hold on to
Fortunately I have this image to hold on to the memory of that lovely day
Its surprising the number of waterfalls in the book that have never been documented or photographed before comments Rehbein who includes GPS coordinates to help determined hikers get to the balletic water displays a few of which he accessed only by a rope and a prayer
The writing photographing pair agree quest is a good word to use for what they do
To get the right picture at the right time or sometimes just to get there youre struggling with the terrain or dangling off a cliff Rehbein explains
For num percent of his own waterfall excursions his wife Phyllis accompanies him he estimates the other num percent hes taking chances
In photographing falls it is imperative to understand containing the beauty of running water in a still frame
For the ethereal blurred effect Sanger uses his tripod and an extended exposure
He prays for cloudcovered skies saying its impossible to get a good waterfall shot on a sunny day
Rehbein concerns himself with composition within the photographs having developed a good eye for a dramatic foreground midground and background as in his photograph of the Lower Laurel Creek waterfall cresting the books cover
Each captured quicksilver freefall is a dramatic testament to the breathtaking exhibition West Virginia can be something Rehbein and Sanger purposed from the start
Encapsulated in both photography and description including artists commentary meant to transport the reader to the moment each photograph was taken the waterfalls didnt allow the discovering pair to name them like Adam did his new animals
We didnt feel like it was our place to do that says Rehbein but we did give them titles within the book that impart some meaning
Like Sweet Repose at Craig Branch off the Kaymoor Trail
Rehbein writes at this lovely fall Craig Branch momentarily hesitates
The water courses over three stately drops and then fans out over a flat sandstone layer
Its a sweet repose for the waters swift descent as well as the waterfall hunters slow upward climb
The visually stimulated as well as the contemplative reader will find West Virginia Waterfalls The New River Gorge as much fun to read as it is to look at
The response to Rehbein and Sangers book has been tremendous it was quickly the best selling and most marveledat volume for the publishers West Virginia Book Festival presence in Charleston back in October
Featured at Tamarack and available on Amazoncom for $num the book has so far engaged buyers from as far away as California who now possess indelible proof of West Virginias natural elegance
Our big thing is preserving and protecting the Gorge and the state says Sanger
The more people know about it the more they will fall in love with it
There are people out there who will want to go find these falls
Rehbein adds We wanted to increase peoples awareness of the beauty here and to know that a lot can be seen with a little extra trouble
The authors are already working on their second book
It covers the Potomac Highlands region Tucker and Grant counties including Canaan Valley says Sanger

Keeping Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in business will cost taxpayers billions
But getting the federal government out of the mortgage business would cost home buyers dearly in the form of higher interest rates
The Obama administration will begin tackling this dilemma next Tuesday at a public conference on the future of the mortgage system
Fannie and Freddie lost a combined $num billion in the ApriltoJune quarter and have needed more than $num billion to stay afloat since the government rescued them nearly two years ago
Figuring out what to do with Fannie and Freddie could take years and involves a more difficult question How much should the government do to subsidize the housing market
The government has helped make mortgages attractive to Americans for decades with a range of policies from allowing homeowners to deduct mortgage interest payments to backing loans that make longterm fixedrate mortgages widely available
Now Fannie and Freddie are facing scrutiny for the billions that taxpayers have covered for the bad loans made during the housing boom
And the administration and Congress are under pressure to address Fannie and Freddies role that contributed to the mortgage crisis after leaving that out of the broader financial regulatory overhaul
Some would like the government to scale back its support for Fannie and Freddie to give the private sector a chance to compete
But others say ending it is unrealistic because it would make the numyear fixed rate mortgage less available or more expensive
When Congress overhauls the housing finance system its going to have to preserve something close to the status quo said Jaret Seiberg an analyst with Concept Capitals Washington Research Group
Our whole housing system is built upon the ability of borrowers to get numyear fixedrate mortgages
You just cant remove that product from the market
Without the governments backing banks would prefer not to make loans that leave interest rates fixed for more than five years
They dont want to take the risks that interest rates will skyrocket leaving them with an unprofitable loan a decade later
Fannie and Freddie buy home loans from lenders package them into bonds with a guarantee against default and sell them to investors
The pair nearly collapsed two years under the weight of soaring foreclosures and defaults
On Monday Freddie said it lost $num billion or $num per share in the ApriltoJune period
The company lost $num million or num cents a share in the same quarter last year
And it asked for an additional $num billion from the federal government bringing its total request to $num billion
There are numerous ways to restructure the mortgage system ranging from a fully privatized system to one totally controlled by the government
Heres a look at some of the options
A FULLY PRIVATE SYSTEM Fannie and Freddie would be eliminated and private lenders would take over either holding loans on their books or selling mortgage bonds
But the market for mortgage securities issued without any government backing has been virtually dead ever since the housing bust
Its unclear whether it can come back
A SEMIPRIVATE SYSTEM Fannie and Freddie would be dissolved
Their function would be assumed by private companies which would apply for permission to issue governmentbacked mortgage securities
They would pay the government for the ability to do so creating a governmentrun insurance fund to absorb losses if the market went bad
This arrangement would ensure numyear loans are available even during bad economic times and limit the damage to taxpayers for future meltdowns
Still mortgage rates could rise under this scenario and smaller banks might not like this because it could increase the power of the nations biggest banks
A HYBRID SYSTEM Fannie and Freddie would continue to exist but would compete against other companies that would issue governmentbacked mortgage securities
A GOVERNMENTRUN SYSTEM Fannie and Freddie would be folded into the government
This option is unlikely because it would further balloon the alreadyexpanding federal debt
Experts say Congress is likely to choose a semiprivate or hybrid system
In the end the politics are going to dictate that some sort of guarantee remains said Republican economist Douglas HoltzEakin a former adviser to Sen John McCains presidential campaign
Obama administration officials are giving only vague hints about where they stand
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said last month the administration wants to bring fundamental change to the mortgage market but offered few specifics
But he hinted that he sees some role for the government
Xcel Energy is seeking to shrink its targets for solar power generation by num percent following a dispute with a billionaire landowner
In a num plan filed with state regulators Xcel said it hoped to acquire num megawatts from solar power by num
On Friday it asked to lower that to num megawatts
Xcel says its not sure a proposed nummile $num million transmission line to carry solar power generated in the San Luis Valley will be ready in num as originally planned
Hedgefund manager Louis Bacon has said he doesnt want the line built over his numacre Trinchera Ranch and says a cheaper alternative route was ignored
Ranch spokesman Cody Wertz says other alternatives can protect one of Colorados last undeveloped scenic corridors
Bobby Jindal sat down with college leaders Tuesday to discuss next years budget shortfall after receiving criticism hes spent too much time traveling and promoting his book and not enough on the states financial troubles
Among the ideas offered higher education officials recommended that students pay higher fees to help offset some of the budget cuts
Jindal said hell consider that proposal and other suggestions to give campuses more management flexibility to cope with reductions
No final decisions were made about what Jindal would support
Jindals meeting with the presidents of the four university systems and a leader of the Board of Regents was the first of several gatherings the governor has planned with stakeholders in the budget discussion
Those include people who want to offer thoughts for how to cope with the $num billion budget shortfall facing the state in the num fiscal year
or at least want some insight into what Jindal will recommend for the budget year starting July num
Jindal said hell talk with elementary and secondary education officials Wednesday and health care representatives Thursday
This is an opportunity to share ideas
Everything is going to be on the table
Were going to talk about how we work together the Republican governor said
Jindal described the conversations as a way to get suggestions but its also clear the meetings are designed to combat complaints that he has focused too much on outofstate campaigning and on touting his book Leadership and Crisis
The discussion with higher education officials follows Jindals suggestion that previous rounds of budget cuts werent as bad as theyve been portrayed by college leaders and as he tries to get a handle on the debate before new cuts are imposed on campuses next year
In recent speeches the governor has said its not that college and university budgets cant be reduced but that administrators need to find efficiencies and trim unnecessary spending
Hes talked of a need for leaders to stop whining and his administration has said tuition and fee hikes on students have offset a large portion of college budget cuts so far
That rhetoric was missing Tuesday as the governor and the university system presidents talked about finding common ground having an unfiltered conversation and considering ways to lessen the impact of cuts on campuses
Randy Moffett president of the University of Louisiana System said the group talked about a need to get on the same page in terms of message
Louisiana Community and Technical College System President Joe May said the meeting moved past broad rhetoric and focused on specific ideas offered by higher education leaders to improve their budget situation
The governor was very clear I think in everything he stated that he wants to be sure that at the end of the day we have not done catastrophic damage to higher education said LSU System President John Lombardi
What we have here is a commitment to work with us to see if we cant get this down to some reasonable level thats survivable
Will it still be painful
College officials have said the cuts already made to state funding of colleges
$num million since the reductions began two years ago
have forced program closures the loss of student services and fewer educational opportunities for students
Theyve said the cuts looming for the next fiscal year
estimates range from $num million to $num million

Founders of Green Valley Holdings announced their bid to buy the failed resorts assets Monday from JeanPierre Boespflug the Frenchborn cofounder of the ski and golf resort in the mountains num miles north of Boise
Green Valley cofounder Matthew Hutcheson said the company was formed specifically to buy Tamarack and finish construction projects that have been mothballed since March num when bankers pulled the plug

New York Citys Tavern on the Green once Americas top grossing restaurant will soon be back in business but not with the same meatandpotatoes fare
Instead visitors to the bankrupt Central Park establishment will line up at vendor food trucks for dining al fresco starting Oct num
The trucks will roll in with trendy street eats like Turkish tacos Chinese dumplings and chili sesame noodle salad at the spot where the Taverns Crystal Room stood
The city still plans to field bids to take over the entire Central Park landmark which remains idle inside
For now four vendors will set up shop facing Sheep Meadow from about num am to num pm
One is called the Ladle of Love serving homemade soups and stews
and other tastetempters like fried truffled chickpeas in an environmentally friendly compostable cup
New York City is not only the city that never sleeps it is the city that always eats
everywhere Parks Recreation Commissioner Adrian Benepe said Thursday
We are thrilled that high quality food will continue to be made available to the public at Tavern on the Green
Dont expect burgers or hot dogs
Pera Mediterranean Brasserie which operates a restaurant on Madison Avenue promises to be the nations first Turkish taco truck
With fillings including a housemade lamb bacon BLT and tuna nicoise theyll go for $num to $num apiece
Ladle of Love soups and stews like beef bourguignon will cost $num to $num
for num ounces with a wholegrain roll
Also on the menu are BBQ pulled pork sandwiches for $num to $num and overthetop brownies at $num to $num stuffed with fillings like pecan caramel and handmade marshmallows
We had to compete to be here in one of the most glamorous priciest city neighborhood said owner Leslie Lampert who was inspired to start her farmtokitchen food business in suburban Westchester County after spending months bringing soups to firefighters going to work at the World Trade Center site
Each vendor had to petition parks officials for the Tavern on the Green venue
City officials were particularly keen on attracting socalled green vendors
Lamperts truck is green meaning cutlery is made from corn and vegetable products and the vehicle is hybridelectric using about half as much power as other such trucks
Ladle of Love signed a oneyear $num concession with a renewal option the other vendors are operating there under similar terms
Rickshaw Dumpling Truck will have a menu of dumplings with flavors like pork and Chinese chive chicken and Thai basil with sides of chili sesame noodle salad and miso soup
The Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream Truck features flavors such as pistachio currants and espresso plus various coffees and pastries
The four vendors were selected from a pool of num applicants
They may also apply for liquor licenses
The original Tavern on the Green served its last meal and closed its doors on New Years Eve after num years its faded magnificence buckling to the recession
About three years ago it was still one of the worlds topgrossing restaurants plating more than num meals a year that brought in about $num million
In January everything in the bankrupt restaurant was up for auction
from the kitschy chandeliers of capitalism to a banner touting the motto of communism
Proceeds went toward the $num million debt
A former sheepfold off Central Park West the defunct Tavern sits on city property
Warner LeRoy took over its operating license in num refurbishing it with whimsical objects purchased around the world
From the Soviet Union came a red velvet banner inscribed in Russian with the international communist motto Workers of all nations unite
In New York reality the cost of keeping a large group of unionized workers was the reason the restaurant did not reopen earlier this year under a new operator industry observers say
Restaurateur Dean Poll said he would not go forward with plans to take over because it was impossible to come to an agreement with the Local num of the Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union
The city has set no date for requesting new proposals for the Tavern
For now workers are fixing the roof and renovating the red brick building while they finish setting up the vendor terrace with tables and chairs

The disclosures were required due to a provision the Vermont independent inserted in the financial regulatory reform bill which was passed in July
Sanders said the num transactions make the $num billion Wall Street bailout President Bush signed into law look like pocket change
He called the disclosures a major victory for the American taxpayer and for transparency in government
After years of stonewalling by the Fed the American people are finally learning the incredible and jawdropping details of the Feds multitrilliondollar bailout of Wall Street and corporate America Sanders said during a conference call with reporters
As a result of this disclosure other members of Congress and I will be taking a very extensive look at all aspects of how the Federal Reserve functions and how we can make our financial institutions more responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans and small businesses
The disclosures showed trillions of dollars in loans at zero or nearzero interest rates to large financial institutions and corporations from Dec num num to July num num
Recipients included General Electric McDonalds and Verizon
The Fed also loaned money to foreign private banks and corporations
The Fed said it took the action to restore the flow of credit to families and businesses and support economic recovery and job creation in the aftermath of the crisis
The transactions helped support the mortgage and housing markets stabilized dollar funding markets abroad and provided liquidity to institutions whose failure could have further stressed a fragile financial system according to a Fed statement
As financial conditions have improved the need for the broadbased facilities has dissipated and most were closed earlier this year a Fed statement said
The Federal Reserve followed sound riskmanagement practices in administering all of these programs incurred no credit losses on programs that have been wound down and expects to incur no credit losses on the few remaining programs
Sanders said the Fed should have required the big banks to increase lending to small and medium businesses and credit card issuers to lower interest rates as conditions of the bailout
Most surprising he said were the funds that went to foreign private banks and corporations through the Feds purchase of mortgagebacked securities
Has the Federal Reserve of the United States become the central bank of the world
Sanders said he would investigate whether big banks used the loans as corporate welfare by lending the money back to the federal government at a higher interest rate through Treasury security purchases
He also questioned how many banks avoided limits on executive compensation by paying back bailout money and taking nostringsattached Fed loans instead
Sanders amendment also directs the Government Accountability Office to audit all emergency actions by the central bank from the start of the financial crisis in num until the Wall Street reform bill was enacted in July
Sanders said he wants the GAO to investigate potential conflicts of interest
The investigation due in July will be the first audit of the Fed he said
The Feds statement says it is committed to transparency and it has previously provided information on its facilities in weekly and monthly reports
But Sanders has been demanding emergency loan information since early last year
At a March num hearing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Sanders that revealing the recipients would be counterproductive
It is unfortunate that it took this long and it is a shame that the biggest banks in America and Mr Bernanke fought to keep this secret from the American public every step of the way Sanders said

Six lenders who have combined to file nearly num foreclosure actions in New Jersey this year face the possible suspension of their operations next month under a court order announced Monday by state Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner
The action follows a report submitted to the Supreme Court that citing depositions and court filings in other states paints a picture of systemic abuses in the filing of foreclosures that include socalled robosigning in which employees signed hundreds of documents without checking them for accuracy
In one instance cited in an administrative order an employee of OneWest Bank formerly IndyMac Federal Bank said in a deposition that she signed num documents a week taking no more than num seconds per document and relying on others to check the documents accuracy prior to signing
Employees testifying in other depositions said they were authorized to sign documents despite having no background in the mortgage industry and little or no understanding of what they were signing
OneWest and five other lenders were ordered to appear in state Superior Court in Trenton on Jan num to demonstrate why the state shouldnt suspend their foreclosure actions
The others are Ally Financial formerly GMAC BAC Home Loan Servicing a subsidiary of Bank of America JP Morgan Chases Chase Home Finance Wells Fargo Financial New Jersey and CitiResidential Living a subsidiary of Citibank
Its important that the judiciary ensures judges are not rubberstamping documents that may not be reliable Rabner said in a conference call Monday
He said he believes New Jersey is the first state to take such action against mortgage lenders a view echoed by Ira Rheingold an attorney and executive director of the Washingtonbased National Association of Consumer Advocates which has tracked the foreclosure crisis
To have a state Supreme Court haul in these lenders its something I have not seen reach this level Rheingold said
Spokespeople for Bank of America and Ally Financial said the companies wouldnt comment on the order
Wells Fargo spokesman Jason Menke said the company intends to comply with the New Jersey courts order and demonstrate why the foreclosures scheduled in New Jersey should move forward
The other companies didnt immediately respond to email or phone messages seeking comment
Rabner announced that num other lenders will be required to submit documentation to a special master retired state Superior Court Judge Walter R Barisonek to demonstrate that there are no irregularities in their handling of foreclosure proceedings
Rabner stressed that that group of lenders has not been accused of wrongdoing and was selected because each had processed at least num foreclosures this year
The six lenders scheduled to appear in court next month have processed more than num foreclosures in New Jersey this year Rabner said
The other num have filed about num
The total represents nearly threequarters of the num foreclosures filed in New Jersey a number that has tripled since num Rabner said
More problematic he said is that num percent of the foreclosures have been uncontested often due to homeowners inability to afford legal counsel
That means theres no meaningful adversary process to protect them Rabner said
The Supreme Court on Monday also issued an order requiring attorneys in all residential foreclosures to certify that lenders have reviewed documents for accuracy and confirmed the accuracy of all court filings
Homeowners in several states have filed lawsuits recently alleging their homes were foreclosed on even though they were up to date on mortgage payments
In some cases banks carted away belongings and changed the locks on the wrong homes

It isnt enough to scrutinize the foods she eats avoiding barbecue and fried chicken
So sensitive is her allergy that even the air she breathed at work posed a threat of paprika wafting from coworkers lunches
Desperate to protect herself Kysel thought she had found the perfect line of defense a $num specially trained paprikasniffing pooch named Penny
But there was a problem
On the first day Kysel brought the golden retriever to her job at Indianapolis code enforcement office one of her coworkers suffered an asthma attack
The coworker was allergic to Penny
Kysel says the city told her to leave the dog at home or take unpaid leave
Two days later on Jan num she filed a discrimination complaint with the US
She has not returned to work
In March Kysel said she turned down the citys only settlement offer $num in exchange for confidentiality dropping the EEOC complaint and agreeing not to sue or ever seek a city job again
Im not looking for a payday said Kysel who along with the city is awaiting the EEOCs finding
Im not going to give up very easily
Greg Fehribach an Indianapolis attorney representing the city in the EEOC matter declined to discuss the case
He said the city recognizes the importance of accommodating employees disabilities
The city in no way violated the law Fehribach said
Its the citys position that we were reasonable in our accommodation not only for this particular employee but for all of our employees
As Kysel portrays it her bosses refused to consider a compromise such as restricting the dogs movements or transferring Kysel to other city buildings that allow service dogs
She has applied for other city jobs since then she said but has received no response
Claims based on food allergies are less settled under federal law than other disabilities covered by the Americans With Disabilities Act especially in the workplace
An employers duty is to accommodate reasonable requests that wont require undue hardship
But disputes over food allergies are more common in education think of childrens peanut allergies which have prompted many schools to ban peanuts from buildings
Kysel num first experienced a severe reaction to paprika as a junior at Indiana University
Since then the Michigan City native has gone into anaphylactic shock a severe reaction many times each seemingly worse than the last
To stop them she relies on an inhaler a jab with an antiallergy injection or even a visit to an emergency room
Until I had the allergy I couldnt even tell you what paprika tastes like Kysel said
And now I know it tastes like fire
Chris Kuczynski assistant legal counsel at the EEOC and head of its ADA policy division declined to comment on Kysels claim which still is being investigated
The employee who was allergic to Kysels dog has not been identified
This does come up and it does come up with service animals when people have rather serious allergic reactions to the animals Kuczynski said
The difficulty comes in treating each employee equally he said
The Department of Code Enforcement where Kysel began working in March num as an analyst responded by educating coworkers after Kysel experienced the first of several allergic reactions
She remembers one reaction was set off by a coworker eating chicken wings at a desk across the room from hers
I just happened to walk past her desk Kysel said
Some coworkers snickered at her condition she said but others expressed concern
The city agency banned paprika from the lobby of its building and asked employees to eat in the break room
As her reactions intensified Kysel contacted a dogtraining facility near Austin Texas and waited for Pennys monthslong training to finish while gaining approval for the idea from her bosses
Her family helped raise some of the $num needed for the service dog
Kysel said she had worked with Julie Paini the citys disability affairs director to smooth the way
But it was Paini she said who notified her late on Pennys first day that the arrangement wouldnt work because of the other workers dog allergy and asthma
Paini who was out of the office Tuesday did not return a message seeking comment
Kysel said returning to work for the city seems unlikely even if the EEOC rules in her favor
She hopes to prove a point suspecting the city would have treated a blind employee with a guide dog differently
But she sees a silver lining in Penny who has helped her avert as many as a dozen exposures to paprika she said
Her last allergic reaction was in October
I dont regret getting her she said
even though everything went awry afterward

Republican Govelect Scott Walker said on the campaign trail the state Department of Natural Resources is out of control but its not clear yet what hell do to the agency that regulates hunting fishing and the states environmental resources
Theres never been any love lost between the DNR and Republicans who have clashed with the agency over everything from pier regulations to how many deer roam the state
Now with a GOP Legislature behind him Walker can rein in an agency that most everyone it seems loves to hate
I will make sure the DNR treats Wisconsinites as customers not criminals Walker said on his campaign website
But environmentalists and conservationists are bracing for changes
I dont know if its a Republican Legislature and governor good or bad said Ed Harvey president of the Conservation Congress an influential group of sportsmen that advises the DNR
No one is fond of the agency
For years its been popular to forget about your opponent and just run against the DNR
Republicans have a long list of grievances with the DNR
They say the agency has a serious public relations problem
Too many people think the agency operates with carte blanche authority and ignores public sentiment
Much of the anger has centered on deer Wisconsins signature animal
Landowners and deer hunters for years have balked at the DNRs call to kill every deer in areas infected with chronic wasting disease
Frustration has been rising with the agencys herd control policies too
Hunters have complained about a confusing hodgepodge of multiple hunting seasons and earnabuck regulations which require hunters to kill an antlerless deer before they can take a buck
They say the DNR has grossly overestimated the deer population and the policy has devastated the herd putting the states $num billion deer hunting industry in jeopardy
The DNR is not viewed as customer friendly
The typical person in the state feels the DNR reports to no one said state Sen Neal Kedzie RElkhorn a former chairman of the Senate Environmental Committee who wants that job back now that Republicans control the chamber again
Walkers website outlines a number of vague initiatives for the agency
They call for allowing more access to public lands simplified regulations a faster environmental permit process and an independent whitetail deer trustee to revise the DNRs population counting system
He has proposed eliminating earnabuck and herd control hunts saying the state needs to return to a more traditional fall season
And he promised to create groups of sportsmen conservationists business owners and rankandfile DNR employees to advise him on regulations and agency practices
He also wants to require annual audits of the agencys fish and wildlife accounts

Harry Potter fans are all abuzz about butterbeer and theyve got the foamy mustaches to prove it
The cold and creamy frothy drink is the most popular food item at the new Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando according to Universal spokesman Tom Schroder with visitors lining up to try it
Then they would walk around and have this mustache on said Sabrina Sampson num of Richmond Va who described the drink as tasting like cream soda
It was somewhat thick and it was really sweet and then it got salty as you swallowed it like butterscotch
Schroder said that about half the visitors to The Wizarding World sample butterbeer
There may be no bigger product launch smash this year than butterbeer WalletPopcom said
Its interesting that one small thing they can sell for a few dollars is getting as much attention as the rides said Gabe Travers who reviewed the park for WESHcom the NBC affiliate in the Orlando area
Immediately after The Wizarding Worlds June num opening butterbeer was one of the most searchedfor terms on the Internet
A butterbeer recipe on MuggleNetcom got num hits when the park opened up from an average num daily views before the opening according to MuggleNetcom spokesman Andrew Sims
Now the recipe is averaging num daily views
Even DISboardscom a site for fans of Disney World has a separate thread for comments related to Universals butterbeer
Universal would not release its butterbeer recipe but press materials describe the drink as reminiscent of shortbread and butterscotch
In the Harry Potter books butterbeer appears to have an inebriating effect and some older online recipes include butterscotch schnapps but the Universal version is nonalcoholic
In Bon Appetits January num issue author JK Rowling was asked what butterbeer tastes like and she said I made it up
I imagine it to taste a little bit like less sickly butterscotch
The version sold at The Wizarding World was tasted and approved by Rowling herself
Everyone knows butterbeer was approved by JK Rowling so people want to taste it and see if their tastebuds match up said Travers
Visitors to the park see a large wooden barrel that bears the word BUTTERBEER as soon as they enter and they can buy it from a street cart and inside The Three Broomsticks restaurant and Hogs Head pub
Butterbeer is sold in two varieties regular and frozen but many people buy both
There are some twofisted butterbeer moments happening said Schroder
The consensus among online fans appears to be that the frozen version is more delicious
The drink is drawn from a tap like a beer and the dense whipped topping is added from a separate tap
Its served in cups about $num $num for frozen for a disposable cup and about $num $num for frozen for a hard plastic souvenir stein
Travers said if he were trying to make the drink at home hed start with a good cream soda
The hard part he said would be the topping It tastes like a Werthers caramel candy but the foam had the consistency of a dairy or latte type of foam
Its pretty dense it floats on top
Robert Lima of Warwick RI who says he still loves all that is Harry Potter even though hes num years old tried butterbeer a week after the park opened and described it as frosty magical goodness
But Sabrina Sampson had one small reservation It was too sweet to chug down but it was good for the first five sips or so

The owner of the worlds largest hog slaughterhouse and the union it fought in one of the Souths longestrunning labor disputes have buried more than num years of animosity
A year after their first labor contract took effect in the unionhostile region the United Food and Commercial Workers and managers of the Smithfield Packing plant said theyve set aside bitterness in a rural region where jobs are scarce
Surprisingly for the num years of fighting we had our relationship is as good as any place with Smithfield that we represent said Mark Lauritsen the UFCWs international vice president for meatpacking plants
Twothirds of the num employees in corporate parent Smithfield Foods pork division are covered by union contracts the Virginiabased companys annual report said
Workplace injuries and the rate of employees who miss work are both down
While the sputtering economy helps keep people at their jobs some say the work environment at the massive plant is better than ever
Managers seem nicer said Pam Norris who has worked at the plant for about three years
They quit yelling and screaming at you said Norris a numyearold from Clarkton who runs a machine that wraps pork chops packaged for grocery stores
The plant about num miles south of Raleigh is the size of a shopping mall towering in the tiny town of Tar Heel population num
Workers who commute an hour or more from across eastern North Carolina and South Carolina kill up to num hogs a day and slice them into pork loins and hams
The plant represents about num percent of the companys worldwide slaughtering capacity
The company and the UFCW locked horns almost as soon as the plant opened in num
Employees complained the unrelenting pace led to repetitivemotion and cutting injuries and about bosses who were strict
A truce was imposed in October num by a federal judge in a settlement to the companys lawsuit alleging the UFCWs yearslong multistate shaming campaign amounted to racketeering
The company estimated the negative publicity cost it $num million
Two elections in the nums were marred by company threats to freeze wages fire workers and close the plant if the union was approved
But in December num a narrow majority of workers voted for the union
In July num employees agreed to a fouryear contract
Smithfield executives declined interviews about the work environment
Our focus is our customers and providing them with quality products
The UFCW leadership our management team and our employees are working well together the corporate parents top human resources executive Jeff Gough said in an email
The cooperation appears to be producing results
The proportion of workers injured on the job who missed work days or had to be reassigned dropped from num per hundred workers in num to num in num before the union came on board state safety inspectors said
The rate dropped again in num to num per hundred workers and is now num the company said
The union which trains workers how to spot hazards said it couldnt calculate the num injury rate because it didnt have firm figures on the number of workers and the total hours they worked
The union will ask for num figures early next year
Problems the company faced with absenteeism or quitting in droves have improved said Carl Green the local unions president
Right after the union election about num percent of the plants workers missed a day of work in the average week Green said
The absenteeism rate now is down to around num percent he said
The unions absenteeism figures differ slightly from the companies but both show fewer employees missing work
A year ago about num workers quit or were fired every month the company said a pace of about num workers a year at a time hourly workers numbered num
Terminations now are half last years level and the head count is num the company said
The UFCWs Green said turnover is down more than sixfold
The lower absenteeism and turnover may have a lot to do with the fact that unemployment rates for counties near the plant are num percent in North Carolina and above num percent in South Carolina
Not surprisingly workers are holding onto any job longer
The number of Americans who voluntarily quit has fallen by onethird since the recession began according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
People are being very cautious and that is probably promoting more retention at their job than if the economy was much improved said Sherwood Southerland who heads the Employment Security Commission region that includes the plant
The slaughterhouse also provides one of the best paychecks in the area averaging about $num an hour
Every week as dozens of new hires begin their orientation union representatives hand employees laminated copies of newspaper front pages noting record high jobless rates to press the point that a paycheck is worth earning
Wed love to say Local num is the reason absenteeism is down Green said
But we do feel some things we say at orientation and in the plant has helped

The open seat for Vermont secretary of state has attracted five major party candidates with four facing off in primaries in August
Jason Gibbs the former commissioner of the state Department of Forests Parks and Recreation and former spokesman for Gov
Jim Douglas is up against Williston lawyer Chris Roy for the Republican nomination while former state Sen Jim Condos of Montpelier faces Montpelier lawyer Charles Merriman for the Democratic nomination
And Progressive Peter Cooper a retired school guidance counselor from Brattleboro is in an uncontested race to become that partys nominee
They are seeking to replace Democrat Deborah Markowitz who is running for governor
Most of the candidates share goals of streamlining the office to make it more efficient and friendlier to businesses and to make government more transparent

Im running because I think the secretary of state can help strengthen the economy and reduce the tax burden by introducing to that office a new entrepreneurial type of public management said Gibbs num
In his num months leading it the Department of Forests Parks and Recreation reduced general fund taxpayerfinanced spending by about num percent or $num million and increased timber and merchandise sales and park visits he said

He served on various county boards and the South Burlington City Council for num years the last eight as chairman
We accomplished a lot Dorset Park bike paths the reconstruction of Shelburne Road the reconstruction of Dorset Street a lot of quality investment in infrastructure in the community paving roads said Condos a former state senator
So we got things done and I think thats part of my record
For Merriman num who specializes in municipal law becoming secretary of state would be an extension of what he already does and has done as assistant attorney general working with municipalities and citizens on issues of open meetings and public records laws he said
I have the track record
Go ask your town clerks they know me throughout the state
Ask the town clerks about what they think about my competency for this job he said
Roy num who decided to run early and has been talking to town clerks about how the office could be improved said its time for a change in Montpelier
Its just a sense that weve had a lot of the same folks in Montpelier I had a sense and a lot of the folks that I spoke had a sense that weve been treading water for a while and I thought there was an opportunity to provide some fresh leadership down there he said

Andrew Cuomo took on a Democratcontrolled state government thats become a national embarrassment and a Republican Party gunning for him as he took a big step Thursday toward winning the governors job once held by his father and Democratic icon Mario Cuomo
Accepting his partys nomination Cuomo mixed liberal Democratic themes like support for gay marriage embracing immigrants and protecting abortion rights with Republican principles like capping property tax increases reducing state spending and shrinking government
He also said that New Yorkers cant afford a tax increase at this time
We believe in E pluribus unum In many one Cuomo said
That idea made this state the greatest state in the nation and it will once again
Cuomo took slaps at his Democratic colleagues in Albany where a national reputation for dysfunction gridlock and ethical scandal has been cemented over the last four years even as a fiscal crisis threatened the states solvency
People are hurting he said
The state government that was supposed to be part of the solution was part of the problem
He had most of the Democratic delegates on their feet cheering as he avoided dwelling on some of his thornier proposals including support for charter schools that compete with traditional public schools and the need to cut state spending supported by special interests like organized labor
I saw a lot of references to change and references to restoring New York said Steven Greenberg of the Siena College poll who attended Cuomos nomination
Given the overwhelming feeling of people right now that the state is headed in the wrong direction its an obvious message for him to try to capitalize on
A Siena College poll released Monday found num percent of New Yorkers feel the state is headed in the wrong direction despite some signs of economic recovery
At the same time the poll gave Cuomo a num percent approval rating for the job hes done as the states attorney general extraordinarily high especially in a time of voter anger at incumbents
Republicans will try to capitalize on that anger which led to losses for scores of incumbents in New York elections last fall almost all of them Democrats
State Republican Chairman Ed Cox went on the attack Thursday saying Cuomo made naive regulations as federal housing secretary under President Bill Clinton that led to the collapse of mortgage markets and a national recession
Cuomo and several business publications dispute claims hes to blame for the housing crisis
Cox also said that when he ran for attorney general Cuomo said he was going to clean up Albany
Well the sheriff of Albany went then to the jail house put his feet up on the desk and closed his eyes to the culture of corruption that has afflicted Albany over the past threeandahalf years
Eliot Spitzer and Comptroller Alan Hevesi Democrats who resigned in disgrace after scandals and three Senate Democratic leaders now under investigation
Cox didnt mention this years corruption conviction of longtime Republican Senate leader Joseph Bruno
Cox said Cuomo only acted on investigations after the cases were revealed in newspapers
He said Cuomo is incapable of fixing the states fiscal crisis including the $num billion deficit in a $num billion state budget that is nearly two months late amid gridlocked negotiations
Andrew Cuomo now says Im a fiscal conservative Cox said in announcing his website wwwPrinceAndrewWatchcom
Well hes been a taxandspend liberal Democrat during his entire career
Greenberg agreed Republicans have plenty of time to make their case and potentially chip away at Cuomos lead in the polls now three times that of his Republican opponents
George Pataki had similarly low name recognition and public support but went on to beat Mario Cuomo in num
Andrew Cuomo will face one of several Republican candidates including former congressman Rick Lazio Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy and Buffalo developer Carl Paladino who is associated with the GOPs tea party movement
Cox tried to dismiss reports that his favored candidate for governor DemocratturnedRepublican Steve Levy was losing support
A Queens Republican leader jumped Wednesday from Levy to newly announced GOP candidate Meyers Mermel a finance consultant
Cox said Levy and Lazio each have between num percent and num percent of the support of Republican delegates at this time
The convention begins Tuesday in Manhattan
This is a Republican year Cox said
The Democrat gang has driven New York state into this fiscal ditch of bankruptcy
Greece raised num billion $num billion Tuesday in a sale of numweek treasury bills that was both oversubscribed and saw a drop in borrowing costs
The sale originally for num million received bids worth num times the total and resulted in a yield of num percent
down from the num percent for a similar auction on Sept num the countrys Public Debt Management Agency said
Last month Greece began regular monthly shortterm debt issues maintaining a presence in the market after its financial woes left it essentially blocked out of the longterm international debt market due to prohibitively high interest rates demanded for its bonds
Although the rates demanded for Greek numyearbonds remain very high the spread or interest rate difference with benchmark German numyearbonds has narrowed significantly recently by about num basis points
in other words by num percentage points
The spread above German bonds currently stands at about num percentage points compared to more than num percentage points in midSeptember
The government has said it hopes to return to borrowing on the international market some time next year if conditions allow
Greece was saved from defaulting on its debts earlier this year by rescue loans from a threeyear num billion package from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone countries
In return for the loans which extend through to May num the centerleft government passed painful austerity measures cutting pensions and salaries and hiking taxes
Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said Monday that a possible extension for the repayment of the rescue loans was being discussed but that Greece had not made any formal request
Papaconstantinou speaking on a news program on the private Skai television station shortly after returning from a trip to the United States where he met with investors and the head of the IMF said there was an ongoing discussion about the repayment timetable of the loans
There has indeed been a discussion for prolonging the repayment of the num billion euros
It is a discussion which has been done but there is no decision in this direction he said noting that Greece faced very high debt repayments in num and num when its repayments will shoot from about num billion up to num billion
It is a discussion which is being done informally absolutely no decision has been taken
Greece has not requested this lets make that clear Papaconstantinou said
He reiterated that Greece did not need to restructure its debts
European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said there was no official discussion on the issue
There is no discussion as such Altafaj said in Brussels Tuesday
There are no concrete plans first of all to envisage this eventuality at this time and on the contrary what we have seen in the last days and weeks is a clear improvement in investor sentiment towards Greece
Including a remarkable decline in the spreads
Greece was on track to meet its targets under the rescue package and therefore there is no case to envisage such an extension he said
Heads up A local entrepreneur is resurrecting the Prince of Pilsener
brewed in the South Side from num to num
will be produced again starting next week at the City Brewing plant in Latrobe
The brand Pennsylvanias biggest seller in the nums should be ready for sale in mid to late July
My idea is to bring back a legend said Mark Dudash num of Upper St Clair a workers compensation and employment attorney who spent the nums working at Pittsburgh Brewing Co in Lawrenceville
I have the passion to do this
I have the materials and I have the contacts said Dudash
He wont say how much hes pouring into the venture but has no financial backers so I dont have to please investors
Dudash signed with eight wholesalers to distribute Duquesne Beer throughout Western Pennsylvania
south from Erie and west from State College
His plan is to expand into Ohio Virginia and the Carolinas if it goes the way I think it will he said
If he prices it right and aims it at people who remember the beer he could make it said Julie Johnson editor of All About Beer magazine in Durham NC
City Brewing produces Iron City and Stoneys beers at its Latrobe plant
It began brewing Iron City last June when Iron City Brewing Co the successor to Pittsburgh Brewing closed its Lawrenceville plant
Brew master Mike Carota who held that post at Pittsburgh Brewing will produce a golden yellow pilsener with three hops for just a gentle bite and extra malt for a bright white head said Dudash
Zack Mazzoni controller for the Latrobe plant said the facility can brew Duquesne Beer without adding workers
The brewery employs about num people including num in manufacturing and about num in bottling
Were happy to have it here
Its an old local brand said Mazzoni
My grandfather had the Duquesne Beer franchise for State College about num years ago said Chris Hickey president of WR Hickey Beer Distributor which will distribute the brand to the five counties around State College
Im looking forward to this
Im very excited to have the opportunity to relaunch Duquesne Beer said Frank Fuhrer who will carry the product to num Western Pennsylvania counties
It has a great name and brand recognition
Dudash decided two years ago to revive Duquesne Beer with the aid of his wife Maria an accountant
They incorporated Duquesne Bottling Co in late num to formally start the project and reregistered the brands trademark which had expired
He consulted old colleagues at Pittsburgh Brewing where he was labor relations manager from num to num
Born in Beechview Dudash said his motivation primarily was that foreign breweries in recent years bought out iconic American beers InBev of Belgium bought AnheuserBusch in num Adolph Coors Co merged into Molson Inc of Montreal in num and South African Breweries bought Miller Brewing Co in num
asked Dudash who earned his bachelors and law degrees from Duquesne University
I think young people are getting tired of the international beers too he said
If you make a superpremium beer and price it right I believe young people will give it a shot
Dudash expects to hold down costs so retail distributors can price Duquesne Beer several dollars below most national brands
The brew will be sold in bottles and not cans he said
This is a great project said Frank Walton the longtime operations vice president at Pittsburgh Brewing who is semiretired in suburban Chicago
But todays market is controlled by the big brewers
If he becomes too successful they will put pressure on the distributors not to carry his product

DEAR ABBY Im a junior in high school and Im worried about my friend Elizabeth
She has always been a TypeA overachiever but for the past year and a half she has been more stressed than usual
School consumes Elizabeth but not in a good way
She stays up until num am cramming for tests even though she studies for several days before
She gets angry and depressed when she doesnt get an A on an assignment
She puts a lot of pressure on herself and her parents dont seem to recognize it
My friend doesnt sleep much and eats very little
At first I told myself that I was overreacting by worrying about her
However last night she was hospitalized for exhaustion and anemia
Shes fine now but the stress and unhealthy habits have caught up with her
Im afraid shell go right back to her detrimental lifestyle
I believe Elizabeth needs help and Im thinking of talking to a guidance counselor
What should I do Abby
DEAR DISTRESSED You are a good and caring friend
Talk to the guidance counselor
Your friends sleeplessness stress anemia and poor diet may come from more than pressuring herself to achieve good grades
She may need professional help and the guidance counselor may be able to see that she gets it

Seven New Jersey Assembly panels have hearings scheduled Monday to discuss how the recently enacted state budget is affecting residents and businesses
But whether the sessions are needed remains the subject of sharp partisan debate
Democrats who control the chamber say the hearings are needed to review how the major spending cuts that Republican Gov
Chris Christie made to help balance the $num billion budget have impacted the state
But GOP leaders view them as nothing more than political theater noting that the budget bills were passed in June with bipartisan support
They say lawmakers should move forward not rehash matters that have been debated and decided
Christie closed an $num billion budget gap in the fiscal year that began July num by skipping a $num billion pension fund payment suspending rebates and cutting $num million in school aid
At the time he described the budget as an attempt to restore fiscal sanity to a state that chronically overspends
Democrats though continue to maintain that Christie balanced the budget on the backs of the working poor elderly and disabled while sparing the states highest wage earners
They called the hearings to address several topics including cuts to FamilyCare an insurance program for lowincome families and police layoffs that have occurred or are planned in numerous towns
The committees that plan hearings are Consumer Affairs Financial Institutions and Insurance Health and Senior Services Higher Education and Telecommunications and Utilities Commerce and Economic Development and Law and Public Safety
Workingclass New Jerseyans continue to struggle with high unemployment soaring property taxes and tuition and painful health care cuts Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said
Businesses have lost vital tax breaks and other assistance stagnating job creation
This budget will have many deep impacts on the lives of New Jerseyans and we plan to monitor it closely to see what might be done to ease the pain
Assembly Republican leader Alex DeCroce said the hearings are a waste of taxpayers time because lawmakers will merely resurrect past arguments
He said legislators should instead be moving forward on reforming property taxes New Jerseys are the highest in the nation and other vital issues
People are demanding reform in government and all the Democrats offer is revisiting the past DeCroce said
Governor Christie has laid out the three Rs of his reform agenda rethink reform rebuild New Jersey
Unfortunately Democrats have added their own R to the equation roadblock to reform
Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak also questioned the need for hearings noting that the Legislature has barely addressed the governors proposed measures to help towns meet the states recently passed num percent property tax cap
Theyve done nothing to assist in this regard
And now they find time for transparently political hearings Drewniak said
Its just more political theater
Rome is burning and they continue to fiddle
The flow of money from specialinterest groups mainly from opponents of the measures has had success so far Both proposals have been shelved by the Legislature despite heavy lobbying by Gov
David Paterson for their passage
A review by the New York Public Interest Research Group shows that liquor stores opposed to the sale of wine in grocery stores and their allies doled out about $num between midJanuary and midJuly to counter efforts by wineries and grocery stores which put in about $num
Another $num in contributions came from groups opposed to the socalled sugar tax which would add a levy of roughly num cent per ounce on soda and other sugary beverages
CocaCola led the pack with $num in donations including two $num donations from its Elmsford Westchester County offices to the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and two $num checks to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee
Democrats hold a narrow num seat majority in the Senate and the money from CocaCola went to the partys housekeeping accounts where there is no contribution limit a major loophole in New Yorks campaignfinance law
When proposals as divisive as these come to the forefront in Albany numerous groups that have previously sat on the legislative sidelines begin to spend massive amounts of money hoping to achieve a beneficial outcome said Bill Mahoney NYPIRGs research coordinator
The money comes at an opportune time for political parties and candidates all num seats in the state Legislature will be on the ballot in November
But the donations didnt stop with legislators and their party committees
Money also came in for the candidates running for statewide office in November
For example Zachys Wine Auctions in White Plains donated $num to Attorney General Andrew Cuomos gubernatorial campaign on July num
Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli a Democrat running for a full term received $num from the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union which is opposed to the sale of wine in grocery stores
The contributions however only give a general sense of how much money has gone into the legislative battles because the contributions arent denoted for a special issue
For example the state Business Council gave $num in contributions over the sixmonth period but it took a stand on a number of issues including support of wine in grocery stores but opposition to the soda tax
Some said the money doesnt always lead to victory
Jim Rogers president of the Food Industry Alliance of New York State said the group last year vigorously fought an expansion of the bottledeposit law to include bottles of water but the measure was ultimately passed
Rogers said that if NYPIRG wants to make the case that were buying influence then we didnt get a very good return on our dollar
The group contributed about $num over the last six months to various political campaigns as it fights the sugar tax which it estimates would lead to significantly higher costs to consumers
The most was a $num contribution to the Democratic Senate Campaign Committees housekeeping account which is used for party activities
The flow of dough isnt limited solely to campaign contributions
Recent lobbying reports show that the American Beverage Association spent nearly $num million over the last six month on lobbying expenses mainly on television ads in opposition of the soda tax
Moreover the New Yorkers for Economic Growth and Open Markets started running television ads this month in the Albany area in support of the wine in grocery stores proposal which state officials estimate could bring in $num million this year in new licensing fees
In the battle to allow naturalgas drilling in the Southern Tier natural gas giant Chesapeake Appalachia LLC has pumped nearly $num million into lobbying efforts since January mainly on ads in support of the drilling
New York States policies regarding hydrofracking will have a profound impact on the future of our state said Susan Lerner executive director of Common CauseNY
It is imperative that those policies are not unduly influenced by large infusions of naturalgas industry dollars in the guise of grassroots campaigns
But industry officials said opponents elevated rhetoric and scare tactics shouldnt influence lawmakers
The Legislature is currently considering proposals to put a temporary moratorium on naturalgas drilling
We strongly believe that New Yorks existing regulations combined with the pending DEC rule changes will provide more than adequate protection to New Yorks natural resources said Brad Gill executive director of Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York

Republican gubernatorial candidates Rick Lazio a former US representative from Suffolk County and Buffalo businessman Carl Paladino will battle it out for the GOP line in November
Five Democrats vying to be New Yorks next attorney general will be on the primary ballot
A number of other primaries for Congress state Senate and Assembly are taking place across the state
The big question is Will candidates be able to tap voter anger over the economy property taxes and political scandals enough to change the historically paltry showing on primary day
Lee Miringoff director of the Marist poll thinks the chances are slim
Theres very little appeal for voters for the primary so the expectation is that turnout will be very very low and that can create upsets potentially because the turnouts so low he said
In the hot of summer I suspect the candidates have shaken far more hands than will show up to vote in September Miringoff said
There may not be enough of a draw for Republicans to vote for Paladino or Lazio because Attorney General Andrew Cuomo the Democratic candidate has a large lead in polls Miringoff said
Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand have sizeable leads against their potential GOP challengers
Two Republican candidates Jay Townsend and Gary Berntsen are vying to challenge Schumer
Three candidates David Malpass Joseph DioGuardi and Bruce Blakeman are seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Gillibrand
One of the big fights shaping up for Election Day centers on control of the state Senate and there will be an early preview of the battle based on the primary results
The Assembly is overwhelmingly Democratic and thats not expected to change
Democrats took over leadership of the numseat Senate two years ago for the first time in more than num years
The split was num Democrats to num Republicans although Sen Thomas Morahan RNew City Rockland County died in July leaving Republicans with num seats
Overall we feel good about our chances of retaking the majority said Scott Reif spokesman for the Republican State Senate Committee
Republicans have an impressive slate of Senate candidates he said
I think every one of our members will have to make their case in their district directly to their voters
But I think what were seeking is antiDemocrat incumbent feelings that are out there he said
There are Republican primaries in seats that are being vacated by GOP senators including outgoing Sens
George Winner of Elmira Dale Volker of Depew Erie County and Vincent Leibell of Patterson Putnam County
The Senate Republican Senate Committee has not taken positions in the Volker and Winner primaries and is confident the GOP will keep the seats because they are in Republicanleaning districts Reif said
For the Leibell seat they are supporting Somers Westchester County Supervisor Mary Beth Murphy over Assemblyman Greg Ball RPatterson
Republicans are targeting a number of seats to take back including those held by Sens
William Stachowski of Buffalo and Darrel Aubertine of Cape Vincent Jefferson County
For their part Senate Democrats have their own Senate primary battles
Several Democratic senators running for reelection face primaries
They include Stachowski Sen Antoine Thompson of Buffalo and Sen Pedro Espada of the Bronx
Also in New York City four Democrats are in a primary to fill the seat being vacated by Sen Eric Schneiderman who is running for attorney general
Democrats though appear unfazed that the primary results will have much impact on whether they retain the Senate in January
The overwhelming majority of the Democratic primaries are in safe Democratic seats and will have zero bearing on whether or not we keep the majority said Eric Blankenbaker a spokesman for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee
By contrast the Senate Republicans are divided in districts where they claim they are most competitive
Reif said Senate Republicans are almost matching Senate Democrats on fundraising
In the last campaignfinance filing a few weeks ago the GOP reported $num million and Democrats had $num million on hand
Senate Democrats said its important to look at how much money has been raised overall
Senate Democrats continue to outraise Republicans num are building competitive campaigns across the state and are fielding a record amount of candidates many of them women throughout the state Blankenbaker said
But both parties have to contend with scandals that have plagued the Legislature
Former Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno a Rensselaer County Republican was convicted on the federal theft of honest services law for accepting money in exchange for his political influence
Hiram Monserrate a Queens Democrat was expelled from the Senate this year after he was convicted of a misdemeanor for assaulting his girlfriend
Several groups not affiliated with political parties are heavily involved in the primaries
Bill Samuels a businessman and former lieutenant governor candidate who has worked with Senate Democrats said he formed the New Roosevelt Initiative named after President Franklin D Roosevelt to find the next generation of reformers
My focus is on how do we improve the Legislature with the longterm focus of making it the best in the country he said
The Legislature has been called the most dysfunctional in the nation
Other groups active in the primaries are Fight Back New York a political action committee seeking to get progay marriage lawmakers elected to the Senate and the National Federation of Independent Business of New York
The New Roosevelt Initiative has spent more than $num trying to defeat Espada whom Samuels described as unethical if not a crook
Espada is being investigated for allegedly siphoning more than $num million from the nonprofit healthcare organization he founded and runs
Espada was one of two Senate Democrats who joined with the GOP to help Republicans gain control of the chamber in a monthlong coup last year
Ultimately he returned to the Democratic conference and became majority leader
The New Roosevelt Initiative has been sending out mailings and campaigning for Espadas Democratic opponent Gustavo Rivera
But Samuels said Theres no assurance we will beat him
Samuels group is opposing Monserrates run for the Assembly
Monserrate briefly joined with Espada to back Republicans in the coup last year
The National Federation of Independent Business is supporting Murphy over Ball for Leibells seat
The group also picked Murphy over the Democratic candidate in the race Westchester County legislator Michael Kaplowitz
We need somebody whos going to be a consistent voice and a consistent vote for business said Mike Elmendorf the federations New York director
The group has made several other endorsements and will continue going into the general election he said
Fight Back New York was formed soon after the Senate voted down a samesex marriage bill in December num said Alex NavarroMcKay a spokesman for the committee
Its main target has been Stachowski one of num senators who voted no
The group decided its best opportunity to advance the cause of marriage equality for the primaries was to defeat Stachowski a numyear incumbent NavarroMcKay said
The committee has been sending out mail and doing radio spots he said
The ads and mailers have not been about gay marriage however
One mailer labels Stachowski as the King of Pork and superimposes his face on a picture of a pig
The committee has some famous donors such as actors David Hyde Pierce and Cynthia Nixon
Stachowski did not respond to a request for comment Thursday

China needs to resolve the case of four Japanese citizens it is holding as the first step toward repairing ties that have been strained over a territorial dispute Japans foreign minister said Wednesday
Japanese trading company officials meanwhile said China appeared to have lifted a de facto ban on Japanbound exports of rare earth metals crucial for advanced manufacturing but that shipments have not yet arrived in Japan due to tighter customs inspections at Chinese ports
Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said the four Japanese citizens held for questioning by Chinese authorities since last week on suspicion of illegally filming military facilities would be visited by consular officials for a second time Wednesday
We want this to be quickly and peacefully resolved Maehara said in an interview with a small group of journalists
That would be a first step toward mending relations with China he said
Both Tokyo and Beijing have said it is up to the other side to take steps to repair ties that have plunged to their lowest level in years over a territorial spat triggered by a Sept num collision between a Chinese fishing trawler and two Japanese patrol boats near disputed islands in the East China Sea
Tokyo released the fishing boat captain involved in the crash Saturday but tensions failed to ease after Beijing demanded an apology over the incident
which in turn prompted Tokyo to demand that China pay for damages to its patrol boats
Straining ties further Beijing said last Thursday it was holding four Japanese citizens that it suspects of entering a military zone without authorization and filming installations there
Their employer construction company Fujita Corp has said the men were in China working to prepare a bid for a project to dispose of chemical weapons abandoned in China by the Japanese military at the end of World War II
According to reports in Chinese state media the four are being held in a hotel in Shijiazhuang in Hebai province
Maehara who in the past has called China a threat took tones that were alternately critical and conciliatory toward Beijing during the group interview
Recent events showed part of Chinas true nature not just to the Japanese people but to the people of the world he said
Still if a clash between the worlds No
num economies leads to less economic activity and exchange it would be a minus for the global economy as well as our two countries he said
Its important that we calmly create a strategic winwin relationship Maehara said
While some lawmakers have been discussing the possibility of sending Japanese troops closer to the disputed islands called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China the government has not made any such decision according to Prime Ministers Office spokesman Noriyuki Shikata
In August before the ship collision the Defense Ministry requested a budget of num million yen to study the possibility of deploying troops to the Yonaguni Islands some num miles num kilometers south of the disputed islands
Officials at two Japanese trading companies said Wednesday that China has apparently started allowing Japanbound exports of the rare earth metals but that the shipments have not arrived in Japan due to tighter customs inspections at Chinese ports
China has denied there was a ban
But Japanese traders said that shipments of rare earths had stopped since last week prompting Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Banri Kaieda to warn Tuesday that it could have a very big impact on Japans economy
Suddenly China started giving export permissions to our Chinese business partners said an official at a major trading house who declined to be named because he wasnt authorized to talk to the media
China produces over num percent of the global supply of rare earths
metallic elements crucial for superconductors computers hybrid electric cars and other hightech products
Japan imports half of Chinas shipments of the exotic metals
Japans economy ministry has begun a survey of Japanese companies doing business with China about whether shipments including rare earths and other products have been affected since the collisions
If there is an evidence that China is unilaterally taking measures targeting Japanese companies Tokyo could take the case to the World Trade Organization Shikata said

Chris Christie the unions foot soldiers local teachers who went into their profession not to become rich but because they love children and want to be a positive influence in their lives say they back their parent organization
They dont do it out of fear they say but because the NJEA is there to help them earn respect as well as a good wage and a decent pension
Local union leaders say they have a good relationship with the statewide organization and that they can agree to disagree
The NJEA is like a life coach for our union
We are one and the same said Robert Johnson a kindergarten teacher at Mantuas Centre City Elementary School and copresident of the Mantua Township Education Association
While some NJEA detractors say the NJEA is not representative of what teachers really think that some would readily accept wage freezes if they didnt have to toe the union line teachers have not come forward to say they are being forced or coerced to join and pay the annual dues of $num for active members
It is not mandatory for teachers to join their local union said NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer although he believes only a small number perhaps num percent choose to opt out
Those teachers pay the union a smaller fee for services they receive in conjunction with the negotiating and administration of their contract
Most choose to join the union and get the full benefits the NJEA provides Wollmer said
He said those who believe the NJEA is not democratic are wrong
The local associations are the bedrock of the whole organization and each is a democratic organization unto itself
They elect their own officials and often the membership will disagree on and debate issues he said
Johnson said the NJEA provides valuable information resources to the num members of his local
Most recently when the MTEA was in negotiations with the Mantua school board to settle a new contract the old one expired last June the local union sought feedback concerning a possible wage freeze
The NJEA told us This is what you stand to lose and laid it out
But they never said Dont accept a zero percent increase because were adamantly opposed to it Johnson said
Several days before this years April num school elections the MTEA and the district settled on a threeyear contract which includes a wage freeze in num
We acknowledge it dealing with state aid cuts is a shared sacrifice
We made our decision based on what was best for our district Johnson said
Ninetysix percent of our members said yes to a wage freeze although some were reluctant
Johnson said that although the move to accept a wage freeze came from the local union the NJEA provided assistance and was supportive once the decision to pursue that avenue had been made
Despite the concession Mantuas proposed school budget for next year was narrowly defeated at the polls by num out of num votes cast
Now the union is facing possible cuts in teacher positions beyond the num that were eliminated in the failed budget proposal
But Johnson said the MTEA did what it had to do
The NJEA doesnt dictate anything to us
We come to them when we need them its not the other way around he said
In the rhetoric that was tossed about leading up to New Jerseys historic school elections that resulted in a record num percent of budget defeats both the NJEA and teachers took a beating
Since the elections the accusations have continued with teachers voicing distress that they are being painted as villains
In informal talks with a number of public school teachers in South Jersey the overriding concern has been that they just want to do their jobs
They say they are not afraid of their local union officials or the state NJEA but do sometimes feel pressured by their district administrations and are angry and saddened that the governor is targeting them
None that spoke would agree to have their names used for this article
Some said that like the Mantua teachers they would consider a wage freeze to save their jobs
Others said they have already given back because they possess one or more graduate degrees and could earn considerably more in the private sector
Officials at the NJEA which represents nearly num individuals including num active teachers and education support professionals say they serve all those teachers
The results of the recent school election have only strengthened the unions resolve they add
Were not going to back down from this governor
Teachers dont understand why hes attacking them
Weve had disagreements with governors before but teachers have never been called drug mules
Its the governors style that is creating the toxic element in this state Wollmer said
Before an unprecedented num percent of proposed school budgets for num went down in defeat on April num Christie had suggested that teachers were using children as drug mules by sending them home with messages to pass the school budgets
Christie would not apologize and was offended that a Bergen County union official who distributed a joke praying for the governors death issued an apology but was not removed from his position
After the voters had their say the question of whether the NJEA would ramp up its strategy denouncing Christie was quickly answered
Were not taking this without setting the record straight
Public education works in this state and the governor is intent on destroying it Wollmer said
With battle maneuvers shifting almost daily the NJEAs latest salvo was to file suit against the state on Wednesday over recently enacted legislation which allows the garnishing of num percent of public school employee salaries for health insurance premium contributions
The lawsuit charges that the new law violates the collective bargaining rights of school employees illegally reduces their salaries and is unconstitutional
The Christie camp is unfazed
During a telephone conference for school districts and municipalities two days after the historic school election New Jersey Commissioner of Education Bret Schundler said he is still looking for concessions from teachers
We dont want school districts to be hurt by these bad financial times
One way this can happen is a wage freeze
We will allow districts to amend their budgets after the formal budget process is complete Schundler said
He encouraged districts to continue working toward teacher wage freezes
If they materialize he said the DOE would allow the districts to rescind layoff notices
Still the statewide organization does not have a position on teacher wage freezes Wollmer said although in general it takes a dim view of the concept
The theory is that once you start taking freezes to subsidize education youre on a slippery slope
Districts that took the freeze this year are still losing positions and failing budgets he said
The NJEAs official stance is that teacher pay freezes must be negotiated at the local level since local collective bargaining contracts govern their compensation and the state organization has no authority in that regard
This is not a statelevel issue
If a school board and its employees want to negotiate a salary freeze that is their business NJEA President Barbara Keshishian said
Keshishian said the governor has been misleading the public by claiming that if teachers would accept a pay freeze there would be no need for higher property taxes or teacher layoffs
Keshishian cited the state Office of Legislative Services April analysis of the New Jersey budget as it would affect the Department of Education in the coming year
The report refigures the amount of Christies cuts to public school districts from $num million to $num billion and goes on to say that health care premium costsharing and wage freezes would reduce that shortfall by only num percent
Chris Christie will go to any length to draw attention away from the fact that his budget cuts are hurting students and schools
He and he alone is to blame for the chaos that is now gripping every school district in New Jersey she said
Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said the NJEAs rhetoric is offensive
Its a nice smoke screen and very effective but its a lie he said
Change will come because New Jersey cannot afford goldplated benefits for free and num percent to num percent raises any more
The NJEA wants the governor to reinstitute the socalled millionaires tax which expired Jan num after passage during the McGreevey administration for a fiveyear period
The union believes this tax a raised income tax for those who earn $num or more would restore $num million in revenues
Wollmer said the union is hoping the state Legislature will enter the fray and do something about the state aid cuts in the budget they must pass by June num
Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Louis Greenwald DVoorhees said there will definitely be changes in the state budget before it is passed but he would not commit to doing what the NJEA wants
All areas are under review
I dont know that it restoring the millionaires tax is the only answer
I dont know if Im there yet Greenwald said
Greenwald said it is the states responsibility to fund education and that legislators are working with a federal delegation to find additional funds to help districts
But he added everyone has to tighten their belts
He believes school budgets largely failed at the polls this year not because many local education associations refused to consider a wage freeze but because property taxes are too high
Property taxes are going up anyway but people dont have the ability to pay any more Greenwald said
Drewniak said the battle lines are drawn
The reconciliation the NJEA would have is for everything to go back to the way its been for decades that the governor and legislators cave in like a shaking bowl of JellO
It would be irresponsible he said
Richard De Lisi dean of the Graduate School of Education at RutgersNew Brunswick said while its clear that the governors statements about the NJEA had some impact on how the school budget votes went this year the fact that many New Jerseyans were already in economic distress could mean that a majority of the proposed budgets would have been voted down anyway
Getting lost in the blame game he said is education
Youd like to see votes go up and down based on the quality of education
Weve heard about money and contracts
But in all of this acrimonious debate theres been very little about the quality of education in New Jersey which I would judge to be very good De Lisi said
De Lisi said that New Jersey standardized test scores stack up well when compared to those across the nation indicating that on the whole public school teachers are doing the jobs they are supposed to be doing
Were voters thinking about that when they voted
Most parents dont want cuts that affect programs and class size but this is a tough time to get people to support budgets De Lisi said
At this point were really standing on the edge
We dont know what is going to happen

Shares of Ritchie Bros Auctioneers Inc tumbled Friday after the company cut its guidance saying net income could fall by up to num percent and one analyst downgraded the stock
THE SPARK The industrial equipment auctioneer cut its guidance for the year in a conference call late Thursday saying it expects net income to fall between num percent to num percent
It now expects num gross auction proceeds to range from $num billion to $num billion down from $num billion
The new earnings per share guidance translates into a range of num cents to num cents from prior expectations of flat growth of num cents
Analysts on average expect earnings per share of num cents according to Thomson Reuters
The company based in Mead Colo said the majority of its guidance cut is due to weakness in the US market
It said that low interest rates lack of confidence in pricing and the hope of positive effects from stimulus spending are all contributing to the lackluster performance
While we still believe there is a substantial pool of used equipment sitting on the sidelines waiting for the right time to be sold the reality is that equipment owners are not reacting to the economic environment the way they have in the past or the way we expected them to act said Rob Mackay company president
THE BIG PICTURE If the auctioneer is seeing weak business in the US that means that companies with large equipment arent willing to spend yet on new pieces
This signals a lack of faith in the economy and a leeriness to spend which hurts the economy because it limits the amount of goods being bought and sold
THE ANALYSIS RBC Capital Markets analyst Jamie Sullivan cut the stocks rating to underperform from sector perform and trimmed his target share price to $num from $num
Jefferies Co Inc analyst Yvonne M Varano said there will be continued pressure on the auctioneer with the timing of a recovery in nonresidential construction still unclear and a lack of selling urgency on the park of contractors with idled equipment

Dear Annie I am num and the youngest of three children
My parents have always been generous refinancing our homes sending each of us to the college of our choice as well as graduate schools and offering financial help
All of us are now married with children of our own and my parents still help us out
Mom and Dad have no hope of retiring anytime soon
While we are all extremely grateful where does it end
I dont begrudge my parents how they spend their money but I worry that they are burdening themselves too much and cant say no
There also seems to be some sibling rivalry developing
Does one child deserve more because she has more children and a lower salary
How about when my wife lost her job
Or when my nephew needed a car
We are all extremely close and I hate to have financial issues dividing us
Is it possible to avoid these brewing battles while still accepting financial aid from our parents
Figuring Out Finances in the Family
Dear FOF None of you should be accepting financial help from Mom and Dad unless it is an emergency
Since you are a close family and are grateful to your parents for their help perhaps you could initiate a sibling conference and discuss the issue calmly
Explain that the folks arent getting any younger and eventually will need this money
Your siblings should make the effort to wean themselves from their parents largesse
It would be better for everyone involved
Dear Annie I believe my soninlaw Carl is cheating on my daughter and I dont know what to do
Carl works for a homerenovation company
His employer recently hired a numyearold woman and it is obvious that Carl has become infatuated with her
He now tries to dress and act as if he is her age
He even got his ears pierced
This girl has been texting him often
My daughter is a little suspicious but doesnt want to question or check up on her husband
Carl leaves the house early in the morning and comes home late at night but she buys into the excuses he gives her
She is very busy with their three young children
Should I be concerned and if so what can be done about his behavior
Dear Mom Let your daughter handle her husband
With three little children to raise she may not want to deal with the possibility that Carl is cheating
And he may not in fact be sexually involved with this young woman
Say nothing derogatory about Carl to your daughter
Should she confide in you and ask for advice however please suggest she talk to a marriage counselor
Dear Annie Out of Ideas wrote about a girl at school who sits at her lunch table but doesnt talk
I am a girl with Aspergers syndrome which is a social disorder that makes it hard to read social cues and communicate with others
Ive also been the person at the end of the table and wish someone had been kind enough to offer their friendship
It was hard not knowing where to sit at lunch because I had no friends and no one was nice enough to ask me to sit with them
Im older now and a little more understanding but still I remember how hard it was
Kudos to Out of Ideas who at least was trying
I hope she will continue
Dear NH Thank you for reminding our readers to be kind
You never know what someone else may be going through
A friendly smile could make their day

China which executes more people each year than any other country said Monday it is considering dropping capital punishment for economic crimes
A draft amendment to the countrys criminal code proposes cutting num economyrelated nonviolent offenses from the list of num crimes punishable by the death penalty the official Xinhua New Agency said
It is not known when the draft will become law
Xinhua said it was submitted for a first reading to the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress
A draft usually has two or three readings before it is voted on
Joshua Rosenzweig research manager for the USbased human rights group Dui Hua Foundation said the draft was welcome but was unlikely to reduce the number of executions in China if it becomes law because it targets crimes that seldom if ever have the death penalty applied to them
Critics say the death penalty in China is used to punish too many crimes and is applied too often
They also say the judicial system is overly secretive in deciding on death penalty cases
Rosenzweig said there was still pressure to have criminals serve longer sentences with the draft also proposing that the maximum fixedterm sentence be raised from num to num years
The draft includes a proposal to abolish the death sentence for people num years of age and older which Rosenzweig said was largely symbolic because there were so few death sentences for criminals in that age group
The website of the NPC which opened its bimonthly session Monday confirmed the draft is being considered but did not give any details
Xinhua said the crimes to be dropped from the list of those punishable by death included carrying out fraudulent activities with financial bills and letters of credit and forging and selling invoices to avoid taxes
Others included smuggling cultural relics and precious metals such as gold out of the country
It quoted Li Shishi director of legislative affairs of the NPC Standing Committee as saying that because of Chinas economic development dropping the death penalty from some economicrelated crimes would not hurt social stability or public security
In recent years China has made several changes to how it decides and carries out the death penalty
In May new rules were issued saying evidence obtained through torture and threats cannot be used in criminal prosecutions and said such evidence would be thrown out in death penalty cases that are under appeal
Those new regulations made it clear that evidence with unclear origins confessions obtained through torture and testimony acquired through violence and threats are invalid
It was the first time Beijing had explicitly stated that evidence obtained under torture or duress was illegal and inadmissible in court
The rulings are important for death penalty cases where a flawed system has led to the deaths of several criminal suspects by torture in detention centers
In num Chinas top court said about num percent of death sentence verdicts by lower courts were found to have problems the official China Daily newspaper reported in May
US consumers and businesses may get more options in wireless service starting next year with the launch of a new wireless broadband network that aims to provide competition to the incumbent phone companies
Privateequity firm Harbinger Capital Partners on Tuesday revealed details of the launch of its wireless network LightSquared which should cover num percent of the population by num
But there are financial and regulatory hurdles to overcome
And in another wrinkle LightSquared wont initially be offering conventional cell phone service just data
Its possible to send phone calls over data connections but that technology is not fully mature or standardized
Still LightSquared represents a rare new entrant in the wireless market
Only two other companies Verizon Wireless and ATT Inc have firm plans to build nationwide networks using the same fourthgeneration network technology that LightSquared will use
Sprint Nextel Corp through its Clearwire Corp subsidiary is building a third one with a different numG technology thats likely to get less support from equipment makers
Consumers wont buy service directly from LightSquared
Instead it will sell access wholesale to other companies that can resell it to consumers
LightSquared hopes to attract cable TV providers phone companies that dont have wireless networks of their own and retailers that want to provide wireless service under their own brand
Dan Hays who focuses on telecommunications with consulting firm PRTM said LightSquared could provide a renewed opportunity for retailers and major brands such as WalMart Best Buy and Office Depot to enter the wireless market as service providers to consumers
LightSquared plans to start providing service in the second half of num in Las Vegas Phoenix Denver and Baltimore
LightSquared said Nokia Siemens Networks will build maintain and operate the network under a $num billion eightyear contract
Nokia Siemens is a joint venture of Finlands Nokia Corp and Siemens AG of Germany
The contract is an important step for Nokia Siemens which hasnt had much of a presence in the US market for wireless equipment
On Monday it announced a deal to buy Motorola Incs networks business for $num billion with a view to increasing its foothold in the US
One reason its rare for new national wireless carriers to spring up is that its difficult and expensive to procure the rights to airwaves across the nation
Verizon Wireless paid $num billion for nationwide spectrum rights in a num auction for example
LightSquared is in an unusual position in that it owns nationwide wireless spectrum once set aside for satellite phone use
Harbinger bought SkyTerra a satellite company earlier this year
Placing calls over satellites is expensive and impractical compared with using cell towers so the FCC allows spectrum holders to back up satellite coverage with towers
That gives LightSquared a back door to building out a conventional groundbased network of cell towers
However under current FCC rules all devices that use LightSquareds spectrum have to come with the ability to connect to a satellite besides conventional cell towers according to satellite industry consultant Tim Farrar
That would add to the cost of devices and limit the selection
LightSquared is banking on the FCC changing its rules to allow devices that only talk to towers
Regardless it needs to launch a satellite later this year to satisfy the FCCs condition that it be able to provide satellite connectivity
The launch of the new network would fit into the FCCs goals of creating more competition in the wireless market
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said Tuesday that he was pleased to learn of the creation of LightSquared
Farrar said its also not clear if Harbinger will be able to raise the billions needed to build out the network and other expenses
Its going to be very interesting to see where this money comes from Farrar said
Tom Surface a spokesman for LightSquared said the company will evaluate our funding needs as we develop and grow our business
LightSquareds CEO is Sanjiv Ahuja who was CEO of French cell phone company Orange from num through num
He then founded a company that started wireless service in Pakistan and Bangladesh
A building boom is on at the University of Massachusetts
At the Worcester campus excavation has begun on a $num million science center one of the largest building projects in New England
Its one of several projects in the UMass systems five campuses and collectively the projects run counter to whats occurring in the weak economy
Over the past year UMass Lowell has bought a downtown hotel taken over a city arena and begun construction of a $num million emerging technologies center
UMass Boston recently bought the Bayside Exposition Center and will begin construction on two buildings at its Dorchester Bay campus
At its flagship Amherst campus UMass has completed more than $num million in construction projects over the past two years and has $num million more in construction under way
The science center is just one of several projects the UMass system is undertaking at its five campuses
Buoyed by rising enrollment research grants and an entrepreneurial culture UMass is expanding an unusual activity in a sour economy
Its also in contrast to delays or cancelations of other projects such as Harvard Universitys Allston expansion Filenes redevelopment in downtown Boston and Columbus Center in the South End
As a result UMass is giving relief to the construction industry which is beginning to recover from the recession
Growth at the university is making the construction possible
State funding accounts for num percent of this years $num billion budget down from num percent about a decade ago
Since num enrollment has risen nearly num percent to about num students as revenue from tuition fees and other nonstate sources doubled to $num billion
Federal and corporate funding of UMass research has jumped num percent to nearly $num million last year
Fees from licensing technologies developed at UMass nearly quadrupled to more than $num million
And university officials say theyve taken an entrepreneurial approach to make the most of whats available
In Worcester for example state funding accounts for less than onefourth of the new buildings price tag
The remainder will be financed with bonds issued by the UMass Building Authority and paid off with research money attracted by the schools scientists and licensing fees for the commercialization of their discoveries
Years ago the attitude was the state would provide UMass president Jack M Wilson said
Now were taking a very businesslike approach and looking for people to come in with an entrepreneurial outlook not an entitlement culture

If you knew you had one year to live would you have medical tests you didnt need
Turns out a surprising number of patients with latestage cancer get useless screening tests for new cancers that couldnt possibly kill them
A new study of Medicare patients with cancers so advanced they had limited life expectancies and little hope of cure reveals a culture of screening on autopilot said lead author Dr Camelia Sima of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York
The study found advanced cancer patients got far fewer tests than healthy people
Still num percent of the women received screening mammograms and num percent got Pap tests for cervical cancer num percent of the men were checked for prostate cancer and num percent of the patients had tests for colon cancer
Doing screening tests on patients whose life expectancy is extremely limited because of cancer is just not a costeffective thing to do said Dr Allen Lichter CEO of the American Society of Clinical Oncology who wasnt involved in the research
The authors have done a wonderful service by pointing this out
The study appearing in Wednesdays Journal of the American Medical Association and funded by the National Cancer Institute is the first to look at the issue of overtesting in latestage cancer
It raises new questions about overdiagnosis and overtreatment in the US health care system
The benefits of early detection of cancer are clear in some patients
But its still uncertain for example how early to start regular mammograms in women
And men older than num shouldnt get a PSA blood test for prostate cancer at all according to government guidelines but about onethird do
Too many tests can raise anxiety in patients and lead to unneeded followup tests and treatments such as radiation and surgery that can have serious complications
People need to understand better that many screening tests are doubleedged swords that should be used selectively not indiscriminately said Dr Howard Brody of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston who was not involved in the new study
But doctors dont want to steal hope from latestage cancer patients and are reluctant to talk about limited life expectancy Lichter said
Doctors treating such patients need to have frank and open discussions of endoflife planning he said
Without such discussions its awkward to explain to a patient why she doesnt need to have her annual mammogram anymore
and you end up having to say Youre not going to live long enough Lichter said
The researchers crunched numbers on nearly num Medicare patients with advanced cancer
Most of the patients num percent had lung cancer
Others had cancers of the colon pancreas esophagus and breast
All were num or older and had been diagnosed between num and num
On average they lived less than two years following diagnosis
The researchers excluded screening tests during the first two months after a cancer diagnosis to make sure they werent mislabeling tests that helped in the diagnosis
Medicare pays roughly $num for a mammogram $num for a PSA test $num for a Pap test and from $num to $num for a colonoscopy
Fixing the problem wouldnt mean huge savings for Medicare Sima said because few patients are involved
And while it might make scientific sense it would be politically unworkable for Medicare to stop paying for cancer screening for patients with less than two years life expectancy she and others said
Brody said the early screening message has been so successful that people think theyre being deprived of something of great value when overtesting is discussed
And politicians have seized on the issue with talk of government getting between you and your doctor Brody said
Sensible health policies will depend on voters to smarten up to the point where this demagoguery no longer works he said

The drop in chip stocks came as the broader market tumbled following a report in a sharp drop in consumer confidence and renewed concerns about a global economic downturn
Even so Citi Investment Research analyst Glen Yeung said he sees little risk of chip companies missing secondquarter estimates
He cited AMD Broadcom Corp and STMicroelectronics NV among the companies most likely to beat expectations
But he said Qualcomm Inc is likely at risk of missing estimates
Shares of Qualcomm fell $num or num percent to $num and earlier in the day they hit a numweek low of $num
As for the third quarter Yeung said there is some risk to chip makers missing estimates
Our checks suggest that order cuts to components took place in AprilMay rebounding in June he wrote in a note to investors
When put in the light of below seasonal thirdquarter PC and handset forecasts we see modest risk to broader chip forecasts currently at normal seasonal levels
Venezuelas oil minister said Friday the government is pleased with an international panels decision that he said limits the scope of an arbitration case filed by Exxon Mobil Corp

Exxon Mobils oil project was one of four taken over by Chavezs government in May num as he brought the oil industry under majority state control
We are encouraged by the jurisdictional decision of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes said Patrick McGinn an Exxon Mobil spokesman
This is the proper forum to hear the merits of our case
He added that the company is still open to holding talks with Venezuela about the case
While we continue arbitration proceedings to recover compensation for the Venezuelan governments actions we remain willing to engage in substantive discussions directly with the Venezuelan government on the issues McGinn said
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday the administration remains opposed to a permanent extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans something strongly favored by Republicans
He said it is critical for Congress to resolve the issue before the end of the year
Geithner said that the administration wanted to see a permanent extension of the num and num tax cuts for families making less than $num annually
He said a permanent extension of tax cuts for households making above that amount would be very expensive
But during an appearance at a forum for corporate executives Geithner seemed to leave the door open for a temporary extension of tax cuts for the wealthy
Geithner said it was important to resolve the issue before the tax cuts are set to expire on Dec num
It has to be done Geithner said during his appearance before a business forum sponsored by the Wall Street Journal
It is very important for Congress to act on this before they leave town
It would not be a responsible act of government to leave this level of uncertainty hanging until next year
Congress returned this week for a lameduck session following the November elections
One of the biggest agenda items is what to do with the tax cuts approved during the Bush administration in num and num which are set to expire on Dec num
Geithner said the administration would approach the upcoming debate using the guiding principles of what is best for economic growth and the middle class
He said he believed the dispute can be worked out fairly quickly and it was important to do so to resolve economic uncertainty
On a separate issue Geithner said that there was a big debate going on currently inside China over how fast to allow its currency rise in value
China is letting its currency rise and it is rising very gradually Geithner said
They are very adverse to a precipitous large move in the value of their currency which I understand
Geithner said it was important that Chinas currency continue to rise in value not only to deal with imbalances in the global economy but also to deal with rising inflation pressures inside China
A centuryold riverboat thats been a shimmering fixture along St Louis Mississippi River banks couldnt survive as an aging casino in the regions fastgrowing glitzier gambling market
But the vessels sellers are wagering they can find someone willing to give the behemoth a go as something else
home until last summer to The President Casino
is on the market on eBay and several other online auction sites as a nostalgic relic in search of a buyer willing to convert the numfootlong numfootwide vessel into anything from a monster houseboat to convention digs upscale dining or more
Theres just a ton of ways to do it Virgil Straeter the owner of an Illinois auction company overseeing the potential sale said Monday before joking You could make a house of it invite every relative you want and never bump into each other
Straeter wont discuss what the boat being pitched as the worlds biggest inland entertainment vessel could fetch saying the $num million price listed on eBay for the boat owned until recently by Las Vegasbased Pinnacle Entertainment was only a suggestion
He identified the current owner only as a private marine company in the region
The standard answer is that well get all we can said Straeter of Auction Associates in Highland Ill Its unique to itself thats for sure
Online offers will be accepted until noon Nov num if the bids dont enthuse the sellers enough to part with the vessel a live auction is to be staged later that day
The boat thats been permanently moored along the river has been stripped of all the gambling vestiges but comes with a considerable cache
crystal chandeliers steam tables office furniture generators and their backups large stoves and walkin coolers
Even garments from its onetime staff not to mention elevators
Theres a grand ballroom on one of its several decks and enclosed observation decks offering panoramic views elsewhere on the boat which towers more than six stories above the rivers surface
There are tens of thousands of square feet to roam including a penthouse
Yet the boat comes with potential headaches
Though the vessel is watertight the hull below the water line requires a new skin
The diesel engines and drive were removed some two decades ago hampering immediate efforts to move the boat
Still the boat comes with a rich history Straeter hopes an eventual buyer appreciates enough to preserve
Built in num as a Mississippicrossing ferry the boat was lengthened by num feet in the nums and converted into what then was the only airconditioned excursion boat according to the eBay listing
The President was one of the first casinos in Missouri after the state legalized casino gambling in num
But over time the vessel permanently moored near the equally glistening Gateway Arch became by far the St Louis regions smallest casino and was hampered by its age size and location
Flooding over the past several years frequently forced it to temporarily close and its business suffered as moremodern fancier casinos cropped up around St Louis
In December num Pinnacle opened a massive downtown casino called Lumiere Place just a few hundred yards from the President hastening the Presidents demise
Lumiere Place according to the Missouri Gaming Commission had revenue of $num million in num the Presidents revenue was $num million
down nearly num percent from when Pinnacle bought it in num
And last March Pinnacle opened its River City Casino in south St Louis County
Last year Pinnacle approached Missouri gaming regulators about the prospect of moving the President Casino elsewhere
No formal request was ever made though after the commission ruled that moving or replacing the President Casino would require Pinnacle to obtain a new license
Though an appellate court later threw out that decision and sent the matter back to the commission Pinnacle ultimately opted to close the President
The CEO of the states hospitality industry is apologizing for sending a joke email to a group of public figures that compares first lady Michelle Obama to a chimpanzee
The Tennessean reports Tennessee Hospitality Association CEO Walt Bakers email compares the first lady to Tarzan sidekick Cheeta
At the bottom of the email is a photo of Michelle Obama caught in an awkward moment with her lips pursed and one of a chimpanzee wearing a similar expression
The email opens with the words I dont care who you are this is funny
But not everyone who received the message on Thursday found it humorous and news of the email which many found to be racist soon began to circulate
On Saturday Baker apologized in an email to Nashville Metro Council members saying the message was not intended to be malicious
Thursday night I spontaneously forwarded
to a small group of people
an email that had been sent to me as political humor he wrote
I am saddened that anyone misinterpreted the sentiments behind the email
I deeply apologize to anyone who is offended by this action
Despite the apology the Nashville Convention and Visitors Bureau which receives most of its funding from Metro said it would drop its contract with Bakers marketing firm Mercatus Communications
Bureau President Butch Spyridon who is one of the people who received Bakers email called it an embarrassment and appalling
Nashvilles hospitality industry has worked tirelessly to create a welcoming environment for our visitors and this behavior discredits the work done by so many Spyridon said in a statement

Zais will push for education reform and higher student achievement
He wants to improve the states ontime gradation rate and certainly efforts in those directions would be positives
Still his comments on some aspects of education raise some red flags
During an appearance in Aiken in late summer Zais suggested that school funding is adequate at a time when state cuts have taken hundreds of millions of dollars away from school districts
The funding crisis will worsen next year when the federal stimulus money goes away and the General Assembly could cut its Knum allocations even further
Zais contends that other sources of funding already exist but has yet to say how that would work or how they would offset the funds already lost and which are not likely to return
We hope the new state superintendent will look more carefully at early childhood education
Zais doesnt seem interested in expanding numyearold kindergarten although it surely is needed for atrisk children to get them ready for kindergarten
He describes himself as an advocate for poor kids but one of his solutions is using vouchers or tuition tax credits to send them to private schools
Such schools of course are under no obligation to accept lowincome children and heres Zaiss response Build new ones
In other words lets divert shrinking state funds to pay for private education and to help pay for construction of new private schools that would have no accountability
There are other concerns too
his apparent disdain for school administrators and his approval of Texas State Board of Education members who simply rewrote history standards to get rid of parts they didnt like
Zais clearly has the drive and experience to be a productive superintendent
But he must demonstrate that he is truly an advocate for public education putting aside the hotbutton political agenda issues that could undermine his efforts
The Times and Democrat of Orangeburg on Govelect Nikki Haleys party challenges
Govelect Nikki Haley is in high profile
As she is the first woman and minority to be elected the states chief executive the national Republican Party is spotlighting her as an example of the new leaders in the GOP
The attention is understandable and fitting
After the campaign analysis cools however the mission will become governing
When she takes over as governor in the new year Haley will inherit a different situation than her GOP allies in Washington
In the nations capital there is the prospect of gridlock with Republicans in control of the House and Democrats controlling the White House and the Senate
Leaders in both parties continue to say the major issues in America are the economy and jobs
Yet they continue to disagree on how to improve the economy and create those jobs
In South Carolina where unemployment is worse than the national average Haley has stressed cutting taxes as a way to create jobs and strengthen the economy
In pursuing her agenda she does not have the obstacle of a Legislature that is controlled all or in part by the other party
Republicans are in firmer control of the Legislature than at any time in history making further gains in this election
Republicans control all constitutional offices in the state
There is only one Democratic member of Congress from the state
So there should be no obstacles for Haley one might deduce
That remains to be seen
Mark Sanford has had with the Republican Legislature has been a form of gridlock between the Republican leader and the legislative leaders of his own party
Haleys positions are similar to Sanfords and she did not enjoy strong support from many lawmakers in her bid for governor
There is skepticism about her willingness to work with lawmakers in a state government dominated by the Legislature
The campaign rhetoric is over
Haley and Republicans are in position in South Carolina to make their agenda reality if they can agree on the agenda
South Carolinians will be watching to see whether putting so much power in the hands of one party will lead to better times
The Post and Courier of Charleston on combating state animal fighting
A recent dogfighting bust that resulted in num dogs being seized in Moncks Corner was made even more distressing by news that at least five of the dogs were to be euthanized
That bust occurred less than three weeks after another one in Berkeley County that led to num pit bulls being seized
For eight years Attorney General Henry McMaster has made it a priority to combat bloodsports like dogfighting and cockfighting
He successfully led the charge for tougher state laws and for increased prosecution of animal fighting cases
The fact that the sickening practice continues is evidence of just how deep the problem goes and how appropriate it is that McMaster fought it
Indeed the spotlight that he shone on the issue is likely one reason law enforcement in South Carolina has made recent busts and arrests seven people in the most recent one
It was two years after McMaster became attorney general that David Ray Tant was convicted in Charleston County on charges of dogfighting He was sentenced to num years in prison and received parole after serving six
His num dogs were euthanized
By comparison in num when Michael Vick then Atlanta Falcons quarterback pleaded guilty to federal felony charges of dogfighting he served num months in prison and two months in home confinement
Attorney Generalelect Alan Wilson has vowed to do battle against federal health care reform address crowded courts and deal with teen gangs
We hope he will also continue the important crusade to stop dogfighting and cockfighting
The cause is worth pursuing not just because of the innate cruelty of the sport although that is reason enough
Many animalfighting enthusiasts tend to be involved with other criminal activities including drugs gambling and violent behavior
Keep the pressure on those lawbreakers
Meanwhile the Legislature should put a stop to bear baiting in South Carolina
Voters in this state backed a constitutional amendment to protect citizens right to hunt and fish
Another way to guard against attacks on hunting would be to demonstrate that we know the difference between hunting animals and torturing them
Its June num and state legislative staffers have thrown off their party labels and come together at a watering hole not far from the Ohio Statehouse to ring in a different kind of new year the start of the state fiscal year
Rockin Fiscal New Years Eve is more than a party
The relationships represented here span party divides legislative term limits and the passage of years
Behind the scenes they will have a role to play in January when the Legislature convenes and lawmakers start grappling with Ohios worst budget outlook in modern history an $num billion hole
It doesnt matter if you are a Democratic staffer or a Republican staffer
If you are a budget staffer the red number is your enemy says Brian Perera the Senate Republicans budget chief since num
Perera num helped conceive the summer bipartisan soiree
A loyal Republican whose late father grabbed headlines as a leftwing activist Perera was raised to defend his politics in a mixed crowd
And theres the House Democrats budget expert Andy DiPalma another founder
The softspoken DiPalma num grew up in workingclass Steubenville along the Ohio River
He landed a job as a legislative page in the nums through a contact made during one of his fathers many unsuccessful runs for Jefferson County commissioner
His dad also named Andy DiPalma is now num and still has his eye on the seat
The notion that were not political and were not trying to box the other side in is a little naive
Theres plenty of that going on DiPalma said
But the relationships the staff have can keep the wheels moving the gears turning when things break down between the members
Another mainstay of the Rockin Fiscal gatherings is Tim Keen a former bean counter at the state budget office whom Govelect John Kasich recently named as his budget director
Keen num started as a legislative budget analyst almost num years ago
After stints in both the state House and state Senate he became an assistant director at the state Office of Budget and Management in num
In num the year of the Democrats nearsweep of state control he served as director
The Kasich transition team isnt allowing Keen to speak publicly yet about his new role
For those outside the political limelight the nonpoliticians the fiscal new years eve party is a chance to cut loose and celebrate the end of months of painstaking work crafting a balanced state budget
Imagine balancing a checking account to the dollar that last cycle was worth $num
The $num billion deficit figure is Pereras estimate
a number that encompasses the loss of billions in onetime federal stimulus dollars used to balance the current $num billion budget
Perera says its more than twice as large as any deficit Ohio has faced before a challenge for even experienced budgeters
We are in uncharted waters at this point he said
DiPalma said the fact hes shared occasional beers with Keen and Perera over the years eases some of the tension associated with the brutal budget season ahead
Despite the increasingly bitter partisan rancor visible to the public DiPalma says staffers get along OK for the most part
Brian Pereras this huge Dean Martin fan and Im from Steubenville which is Dean Martins hometown so we have this kind of mutual interest around Dean Martin stuff which is kind of funny he said
Perera grew up in the welltodo Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington and still lives there with his wife and children
When he was a boy he recalls his father
the late activist John Perera
wanted to swap their comfortable home with that of a needy innercity family
His mom nixed the idea
Charged with mowing the shared circle of lawn on their culdesac John Perera spelled out the word Peace in the grass
He had obviously kindled enough interest in public service within me that I went and did something for the greater good Perera said
As people used to say to me they wanted to sit at Thanksgiving dinners at our house and hear what the conversations were like
At num the Senate Democrats new finance director Justin Nigro is just joining this seasoned band of budget brothers
He is looking forward to the opportunities for change in the budget arguably the most significant policy document of any session
The son of a mailman and a nurses aide Nigro grew up in Ashtabula a once proud Ohio port town thats seen better days
Nigro says theres an empty field where his high school used to be
Thats partly why Im driven the way I am to work for the state to be in public service of the state and to
but to fight for Ohio he said
When things get stormy though theres something a numbers guy
always has to lean back on Nigro says There is some comfort in the numbers because you know theyre hard
A two is a two
The head of the Massachusetts Lottery said Friday his staffers did not collude with state Treasurer Timothy Cahill to run television and radio ads echoing themes from Cahills independent gubernatorial campaign
Mark Cavanagh said theres no truth to the charge made by former Cahill campaign manager Adam Meldrum
In a statement Thursday Meldrum said he was preparing to present evidence of collusion to Attorney General Martha Coakley when Cahill tried to gag him by suing Meldrum and three other former campaign aides
Cahill whose office oversees the lottery alleges they conspired to undermine his candidacy and help Republican rival Charles Baker by arranging last weeks defection of his running mate Paul Loscocco
The lottery is part of the treasury but there was absolutely no conversation or whatever the insinuation was between the campaign and lottery said Cavanagh
Theyll be no emails from lottery to anybody on this thats not how we operate
Attorney General Martha Coakley said Friday she has yet to receive a complaint but we will also reach out to those individuals who have made these allegations to determine whether there is credible information to substantiate the allegations
The lottery ad titled Permission began running Sept num and will continue until Nov num
It is appearing on radio and television with essentially the same script
The TV ad shows images of boats firefighters and other scenes depicting beneficiaries of lottery proceeds
Massachusetts is home to the most successful state lottery America it says
Thats the result of a consistently wellmanaged lottery
and luck has nothing to do with it
Cavanagh said the ad is focused on younger nonregular lottery players people who feel a sense of permission to play when they realize all the profits are returned to cities and towns for public services
The ad first ran in num and has run almost annually since
It did not run last year
Cavanagh said he spoke with Cahill this year about his ad strategy and has spoken throughout the year with Cahills top political aide former treasury employee Scott Campbell
But he noted the ad does not mention Cahill nor does it show him
The exact same commercial can be used by the next treasurer without one change said Cavanagh
How can it be political if the next treasurer can use the same ad
In his statement Meldrum labeled Cahills action against him a political lawsuit aimed at preventing the former campaign manager from gaining whistleblower status with Coakley
This lawsuit is nothing more than an attempt to silence us from doing the right thing for the people of Massachusetts said Meldrum
It is unfortunate that once again Tim Cahill is using the taxpayer dollars to further his political ambition
Ten environmental and American Indian groups from the upper Great Plains are asking the US State Department to revise or deny a draft environmental impact statement on TransCanada Corps Keystone XL pipeline
Carrie La Seur president of environmental law nonprofit Plains Justice says the draft environmental impact statement does not adequately address several issues including the risk of leaks and spills
The groups sent a numpage letter to the State Department on Friday addressing their concerns about the proposed pipeline that would run from the tar sands near Hardisty Alberta to oil refineries in Oklahoma and Texas
The pipelines route would go through Montana South Dakota and Nebraska in the upper Great Plains
A federal grand jury in Las Vegas has indicted four men on charges of scamming Nevada and the federal government out of $num million in fraudulent unemployment benefits over two years
The indictment was handed up last week and unsealed Wednesday against numyearold Francisco Garcia numyearold Eloy Garcia numyearold Efrain Garcia and numyearold Nabor Garcia
Prosecutors couldnt immediately say if the four are related
Nevada US Attorney Daniel Bogden says Francisco and Nabor Garcia were arrested Wednesday in Las Vegas
The other two remain at large
Authorities allege the four recruited illegal immigrants and promised to help them obtain unemployment benefits in exchange for a share of the benefits
The indictment alleges Francisco and Nabor Garcia laundered money they obtained by purchasing homes
A Hawaii company is one of num financial institutions getting awards from the US Treasury Departments Community Development Financial Institutions Fund
Treasury officials announced Thursday in a New York news release that Hawaii HomeOwnership Center of Honolulu received a $num award
In all the fund awarded just under $num million to institutions serving struggling communities in num states and the District of Columbia
Officials say the grants will help the institutions support entrepreneurs and small businesses
They add the funding will also spur economic growth and recovery by expanding access to capital and affordable financial services in underserved areas
One of the few competitive advantages Michigan has on health care costs is that it doesnt have a lot of health insurance mandates
rules requiring that health insurance provide coverage or specific treatments for particular diseases or disorders that drive up coverage costs
This isnt for want of trying
There is talk of yet another attempt
this time in the lame duck legislative session that would involve treatment for autism
The Michigan Information and Research Service reports that there is an effort in the state Senate to negotiate some sort of agreement on an autism mandate package that has already passed the House
The House legislation would require that all health insurance policies cover treatment for autism
The policies would have to offer coverage with dollar limits copays and deductibles that are identical to coverage for physical illness with the exception of a treatment called applied behavior analysis which would be limited to $num per year
But there could be limits on how many times an insured person could visit an autism treatment provider
Obviously this could be an extremely expensive mandate
State Sen Randy Richardville RMonroe slated to become the next Senate majority leader held a series of public hearings on autism this summer that ended last month
The Michigan Information and Research Service also reports that GOP state Rep Brian Calley of Portland tapped to serve as lieutenant governor next year is a supporter of the autism legislation
The Michigan Information and Research Service reports he is the father of an autistic child
Intermediate school districts in this state are now charged with providing accommodations for pupils with special needs including autism
A federal mental health parity bill adopted several years ago also requires treatment coverage for autism
The Obamacare health bill adopted by Congress will also affect autism coverage
So why would the state Senate want to lock a coverage mandate
Autism is a complex condition and medicines understanding of it is rapidly changing
A state coverage mandate introduces unknowns into the state insurance market which is itself in flux because of changing federal law
The House version was opposed by most business groups
But it was also opposed by the Michigan AFLCIO and the United Auto Workers on the grounds that they want to be able to bargain their health care coverage options
It simply isnt good policy to adopt this legislation now and the Senate shouldnt go forward with it
Michigan should offer early voting
Despite the historic significance of the Nov num vote
a Republican landslide that won Michigans governors seat both chambers of the Legislature and the state Supreme Court
there is one change yet to be realized
Michigan still is a state that doesnt allow early voting
Michigan is not stranger to voter unrest
With an unemployment rate second only to Nevada and state government unable to promote effective job growth or enact structural reforms to its annual budget deficits voters had good reason to throw the bums out
Mindful of the pulse of voter dissatisfaction Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land predicted num percent or num million of Michigans registered voters would go to the polls Nov num
On Election Day however only num percent of the states voters cast their ballots
This is not to suggest early voting somehow might have altered the midterm elections outcome
A clear majority of Michigan residents were determined to change the course of local state and federal governments
Making voting a little more convenient wouldnt affect that sentiment
Early voting might have given more state voters the chance however to influence their government
Yes there are provisions for absentee voting
If you are num years or older you automatically qualify
Absentee ballots also are available under the following conditions
The voter is unable to cast a ballot without assistance at the polls
The voter expects to be out of town on Election Day
The voter is in jail awaiting arraignment or trial
The voter is unable to attend the polls due to religious reasons
The voter is appointed to work as an election inspector in a precinct outside of your precinct of residence
Voter participation might be better served if noexcuse absentee ballots were available
and early voting could enhance participation further
The concept is simple Voters visit clerks offices or satellite locations to cast their ballots
The early voting period is about num to num days before elections with the Friday or Saturday immediately preceding the elections as the final day
Voter apathy is a stubborn challenge
In good times or bad Americas election turnouts never reach num percent
The closest was num percent in the num presidential election when John F Kennedy defeated Richard M Nixon
At least num states and the District of Columbia offer some form of early voting
In Michigan which couldnt muster a num percent turnout even when voters were eager to send a message to their government early voting doesnt seem to be a bad idea
Too much noise not enough details from GOP
For the Republicans it is now time for them to show us what their plans are
After two years of playing a silent second fiddle to House and Senate Democrats and the whims of President Barack Obama the GOP with a majority in the House for the first time since num now have a launchpad for their ideas
Unfortunately the noise we are hearing is incoherent
All of us are coming back here understanding voters want this place to change in a meaningful way said Rep Greg Walden ROre whos leading the transition in the U S House from Democrat to Republican control
That said theres Sen Mitch McConnell RKy telling the Associated Press that the first job of this group of Republicans is to deny Obama a second term as the only way it can accomplish its goals of undoing the health care law cutting spending and shrinking government
That was the strategy in the congressional session that is now ending
Then theres Rep Darrell Issa RCalif saying hell oppose any compromise on the Bushera tax cuts
Doesnt sound like a representative willing to even work on the publics problems
Theres the other newlyelected Kentucky senator Rand Paul telling Christiane Amanpour that the US needs a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and that all government spending must be on the table including the military social security and other entitlement programs
Thats a theme that has played out unsuccessfully for decades
Perhaps the underlying strategy for the Republicans is to return spending sanity to Congress but so far weve not seen the type of detail needed to know if they are serious or not
Its easy to make the grand proclamations now when there isnt any pushback
Lets hope to see more details as the transition proceeds
Make deer hunting season a safe one
For those of you who may not be aware the firearms deer hunting season has started
The archery deer season began Oct num and ended Sunday
The firearms season runs through Nov num and a second archery deer season begins Dec num and ends Jan num
This isnt news for area hunters who have probably been anticipating these dates since the last season ended
However although hunters may be fine from a calendar standpoint it doesnt hurt to get some updated information on the new season as well as review some basic hunter safety tips
Hunters should remember that according to the Department of Natural Resources website they must take a hunter safety course if they were born after Jan num num and they need a hunter safety certificate or previous hunting license to purchase any Michigan hunting license
Also hunters should be aware that violating basic hunting regulations can get expensive
Shooting a deer without a license can cost a hunter $num for the reimbursement to the state for the deer plus up to $num in fines and court costs and from five to num days in jail
Hunters could also lose their hunting privileges if convicted
They could even have their hunting rifles and equipment confiscated
So while hunting in Michigans picturesque woodlands and forests may hearken back to a more rustic era and give hunters a sense of oldtime independence the penalties for breaking the hunting laws will quickly bring them back to modern times
If hunters get lucky and see lots of deer they need to remember that depending on the licenses they hold they can bag two antler deer during a season and up to five antlerless deer a day with no season limit in num
The Oakland County sheriffs office offers some very basic but still useful safety tips for hunters
They include Treat every firearm as if it is loaded always point the muzzle in a safe direction be certain of your target and whats beyond it keep your finger outside the trigger guard and off the trigger until ready to shoot all firearm hunters on any land during daylight hunting hours must wear a hat cap vest jacket rainwear or other outer garment of hunter orange visible from all sides and all hunters including archers must comply during gun season
Other tips include Camouflage hunter orange is legal provided num percent of the surface area is solid hunter orange Michigan requires num percent of a camouflage hunter orange garment be open hunter orange control your emotions when hunting or shooting and always let someone know where you are hunting and when you plan on returning
For hunters these safety tips should be second nature but it doesnt hurt to review them
Nonhunters should note that it is hunting season and so they need to take extra precautions when venturing out into our states more rural areas
Overall enjoy the season but make it a safe one
Thirteen energy efficiency projects in rural Maryland will be funded through federal grants announced by Sen Ben Cardin and Rep Roscoe Bartlett
The two lawmakers joined US Department of Agriculture Rural Development State Director Jack Tarburton in announcing the grants Monday at Sunnsyside Farms in Westminster
The Carroll County chicken egg farm will receive a $num grant that will pay for about a quarter of the cost of a new solar power system
Other grants will go toward replacing grain dryers at farms across the state as well as wind turbines geothermal and solar power systems statewide
The projects are being funded under the Rural Energy for America Program also known as REAP
Govelect Paul LePages budget advisers are inching their way toward a twoyear state budget plan as they face tough time constraints and a huge revenue shortfall leaders of his transition team said Friday
But they are making progress and the shortfall
at one time estimated at $num billion or about num percent of the total budget
may not be that high after all they said
Were getting down to a level that will get us close to our revenues budget working group leader Sawin Millett said
I think were starting to see some signs of growth
Millett acknowledged that a shortfall in the $num million to $num million range wouldnt be far off but cautioned The number does change on a daily basis
In a briefing with reporters transition cochair Tarren Bragdon said the advisers are working on an aggressive timeline to meet a lateJanuary deadline to finish its work on the spending package so it can be printed and made publicly available by early February
The budget plan will cover the two years starting July num num and will have to be approved by the Legislature
Complicating matters is the working groups charge to submit revisions to the current years budget by midJanuary which the Republicancontrolled Legislature also must approve
But the real focus is on the upcoming twoyear budget which is expected to reflect major changes in state policy as articulated by LePage during the conservative Republicans campaign
LePage wants a budget thats friendly to job creation offers tax relief eases the states longterm debt and makes state government more affordable
Budget advisers are looking at num savings initiatives submitted by lawmakers the public and advisers themselves said Bragdon
Neither he nor Millett was specific on what those were but some themes emerged such as identifying core state functions that merit funding and targeting funds in social programs to the truly needy
Millett also noted that the governorelect wants to continue a state government hiring freeze Democratic Gov
John Baldacci put in place but not continue furlough days

New Hampshire has sued two tobacco businesses in the state saying their decision to use cigarettemaking machines for customers now requires them to pay into a fund for each one of those cigarettes
And at least one of the businesses has sued the state over being classified as a cigarette manufacturer
The retailers are EastWest Distributors doing business as Smoke N Discounts of Epsom and Tobacco Depot of Seabrook
The state claims the stores are now cigarette manufacturers and must comply with paying into an escrow fund established by the state or into a national settlement agreement between states and major tobacco producers
The suit filed by Signal Variety a company that owns Tobacco Depot says the classification violates the state Constitution

Spains muchpublicized plans to put thousands of electric cars on the road as part of a drive for a greener economy are way off target with only num sold so far
The governmentback REVE electric car and wind power project said on its website Tuesday that num sales are up num from last year when just one model sold
The Industry Ministrys plan was to have num electric cars on the road by the end of num and num electric and hybrid vehicles operating the following year
In April Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced the government would invest num million $num million in promoting and developing production of electric cars over the next two years
The plan was a key element of the governments strategy to try to lift the Spanish economy out of the doldrums and be more environmentally friendly
The economy has now posted two quarters of meager growth after nearly two years of recession
The longterm objective is to have num electric and hybrid vehicles in circulation by num
There were to be num chargeup points available around the country but so far these appear to be few and far between
On its website REVE played down the poor sales
The figures are similar to what happened in the beginning with personal computers or mobile phones it said
The first models are expensive and with few options and initial sales were low
But toward num dozens of electric vehicles with lithium batteries and at a lower price than the current one will reach the market and the recharging infrastructure will be more organized it added
No one at the Industry Ministry or REVE could be contacted for further comment
The num models sold in Spain were made by Norwaybased auto maker Think one of the leading electric car makers
They are twoseaters and sell for from num $num with the government offering up to num in aid
The cars have a maximum speed of num kph num mph and can cover num kilometers num miles between recharges
Electric and hybrid cars are slowly becoming more common in Europe and elsewhere for environmental reasons
Electric cars are smaller and suit cities with narrow traffic congested streets
But manufacturers are aware that the costs of purely electric vehicles will have to come down if they are to become attractive to customers
Besides companies like Think major automakers such as General Motors Nissan and Renault are also working on models
Spain is Europes thirdlargest auto manufacturer but the economic crisis has seen sales slump dramatically
Renault agreed last year to make Spains first electric car in num at its Valladolid plant
Colorado has notched its first three months of consecutive job growth since num
But more hiring has attracted even more jobseekers to the market nudging Colorados unemployment rate up slightly in November
The state Labor and Employment Office said Friday the states unemployment rate has risen to num percent
Thats twotenths of a percentage point higher than the October rate
Employers reported adding num jobs in November

Sears Holdings Corp cut its secondquarter loss by more than half as profit margins perked up at its discount chain Kmart the retailer said Thursday
Still weak shopper spending amid a tough economy led to a decline in an important revenue measure
For the three months that ended in late July the owner of Sears department stores and Kmart lost $num million or num cents per share
Thats better than last years loss of $num million or num cents per share last year
Excluding onetime adjustments the current quarters loss amounted to num cents per share
Revenue slipped slightly to $num billion down from $num billion last year
Analysts expected the company led by billionaire Edward Lampert to post better results

You should always prioritize your todo lists
For many people the list looks like this
Tidy up the viper pit
Read a mutual fund prospectus
Unpleasant as it is however you really should read your prospectus as well as the Statement of Additional Information
For investors in targetdate funds the prospectus may soon have new information that might help you make a decision about your retirement savings
Mutual fund prospectuses protect investors in two ways
First they disclose the funds investment objectives and risks as well as its fees
Second they limit what the fund may and may not do
A fund that says it will keep num percent or more of its assets in bonds for example cant legally put num percent in cattle futures
Why does no one read prospectuses
Because theyre written in legalese and contain lines such as this from the DWS LifeCompass Retirement fund
Portfolio management regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and may adjust it based on current or expected market conditions or to manage risk
In making its asset allocation decisions portfolio management uses a proprietary mix of quantitative and qualitative inputs such as return forecasts for asset classes and investment guidelines
Translation We change the funds asset allocation sometimes
We make those changes based on many factors most of which we wont disclose
When you dont read a prospectus you can get lulled into a false sense of security which is what happened to some investors in targetdate funds
These are allinone retirement funds that gear their investments toward your retirement date
If you plan to retire in num for example youd invest in one of the numodd num target retirement funds
For people who view mutual funds as less interesting than say counting bees it may come as a shock to know that most targetdate funds beyond num are invested mainly in stocks
According to investment theory the more time you have to invest the more stocks you should have in your portfolio
Even savvy investors may have been surprised at the percentage of stocks in targetdate funds whose target date is relatively close by
Although many targetdate funds become income funds when they reach their targets others figure that a retiree will hold the fund through retirement
People who retire at num can reasonably expect to live into their nums an amount of time that would dictate a somewhat large exposure to stocks
To try to prevent such nasty surprises the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed some new rules
A target fund would have to
Disclose its asset allocation its broad investments among stocks bonds and money market securities the first time the funds name is used
Include a chart or graph that would disclose how its asset allocation would change over time including its allocation when the target date arrives
Say that investments arent guaranteed
Disclose how much the funds investments can stray from its targets without a shareholder vote
The proposed SEC regs would also wipe out any suggestion in promotional material that a target fund is a fireandforget strategy that doesnt need monitoring
You can read an investor alert on targetdate funds at wwwsecgov and youll be able to comment on the new regs at the SEC website soon
Targetdate funds are indeed a good investment for people who dont like investing or find the process so intimidating that they would otherwise stuff all their money in the freezer
Its better to have some diversification than none at all
But before you invest check the prospectus or at least the shorter profile prospectus to see how much the funds keep in stocks and whether or not youre comfortable with that
Check to see if the fees are reasonable preferably less than numPERCENT a year
If youre feeling particularly brave crack open the funds Statement of Additional Information
Buried deep inside is the amount the manager has in the fund
A manager with money in the fund isnt a guarantee of good performance but at least youll know youre not suffering alone
When youre done take a long walk with the dog
Top administrators in St Louis and Kansas City pledged Wednesday to lobby against a possible repeal of their city earnings taxes warning that the push advanced by Missouri voters could cost the states two biggest cities hundreds of millions of dollars vital for police and other public services
Proposition A which passed handily Tuesday requires St Louis and Kansas City
the states only cities with an earnings tax
to ask local voters in April and every five years after that to allow the tax to continue
If voters in either city choose to repeal the tax the num percent levy on the earnings of people who live or work in the city would be phased out over num years in onetenth percent increments
The measure has statewide ramifications by also barring other Missouri cities from imposing their own earnings tax
For both cities the stakes are high Kansas Citys earning tax generates $num million a year
about num percent of the citys general fund
while St Louis pulls in about $num million annually a sizable chunk of its $num million budget
Leaders in both cities have said any repeal of the taxes with no viable alternatives to make up the lost revenue could force cuts in services ranging from police and fire protection to the upkeep of parks and streets
Let Voters Decide the committee that supported Proposition A has insisted the measure was needed to jettison what it called a third layer of income taxes burdening workers in a stagnant economy
The group said the taxes encourage people and businesses to set up shop in suburbs that dont have such a tax
Proposition A was approved with num percent of the statewide vote
But the measure was panned convincingly in St Louis and Kansas City buoying optimism among those cities top administrators Wednesday that their voters will reject the initiative come April
But the mayors of both cities are leaving nothing to chance
By Wednesday St Louis Mayor Francis Slay already had helped form Citizens for a Stronger St Louis a campaign committee intent on discouraging the earnings taxs repeal said Jeff Rainford Slays chief of staff
Hes already campaigning today for a Yes vote in April to keep the tax in place Rainford said
Kansas City Mayor Mark Funkhouser said he expects to make the case to his citys electorate that among other things the prospect of losing the earnings tax could force hard choices about where potentially deep service cuts would be required
The citys campaign also would include drilling home that half of the earning taxes paid in Kansas City are paid by people who only work in the city but live in the suburbs meaning voters will have to decide whether to give them a tax break and take on the entire burden of making up the lost revenue themselves Funkhouser said
I have faith voters will make a wise judgment when they hear all those facts Funkhouser said Wednesday
We also have to sit down and make sure Kansas City voters understand that we do know we have to do a comprehensive examination of our tax structure and we will do that
But we cant do that before April
If it passes we will have to find a way to live within our means
Before the election Slay was decried by some Proposition As critics including Kansas City leaders for not being more aggressive and vocal against the measure
But Slay believed its statewide passage was inevitable because it barred other cities from authorizing earnings taxes and that devoting any resources to fight it then would be like flushing those resources down the toilet Rainford said
For months hes been saying its going to pass on Tuesday and he was right Rainford said
And we told voters that if it passes its going to be in your hands in April
The mayor has confidence in the voters and respects that they love their city and wouldnt do anything to destroy it

Nationwide num percent of workers receive health insurance through their employer the group found
Jobbased coverage is the backbone of the United States healthinsurance system David Sandman senior vice president of the foundation said Friday
Its still the main way that New Yorkers and Americans get health insurance but it is a platform that is eroding and is more fragile than it used to be
The percentage of New York companies that offer health insurance has remained steady at num percent compared to num percent nationwide in num
But employers have tightened eligibility for coverage limited choices and required employees to pay a greater share of the cost according to the survey which was conducted for the foundation by the University of Chicagos National Opinion Research Center
A number of them said the cost of health care has been a deterrent in hiring new employees
Theres been very little erosion in the percentage of employers that at least offer benefits to their employees and thats obviously good news Sandman said
The University of Chicago conducted telephone interviews with a random sample of num public and private employers in New York between late num and early num
Most firms said offering health insurance is the right thing to do yet num percent of them said they were struggling to pay for it
The majority said they planned to increase employee contributions in the next year
The cost of insurance has affected hiring and wages the research found
One in five firms has avoided adding new staff and one in four has cut or frozen salaries
The survey clearly shows that healthinsurance costs are a drag on the states economy Sandman said
Employerbased healthcare coverage in New York is roughly num percent more expensive than nationally with monthly premiums averaging $num compared to $num the report said
Over the past decade largegroup and smallgroup insurance in New York has increased about num percent to num percent annually a state Insurance Department spokesman said
Increases could be less or more depending on a specific plan
Healthinsurance premiums have been on the rise for many years in part because the country has not been able to control the cost of health care the use of pharmaceuticals has increased and the United States has an aging society Sandman said
Other reasons include the growth of problems like obesity and diseases associated with then and New York is a highcost state to begin with he said
Opponents of the federal healthcare overhaul believe the measures it requires are driving up costs for businesses
Sandman said the new federal law could provide muchneeded relief to employers and workers such as through tax credits
The taxes on private health insurance in New York total about $num billion a year said Leslie Moran of the New York Health Plan Association whose members provide healthcare coverage for nearly seven million people
When you add all of the taxes on health insurance in New York its at a level that I dont believe exists in any other state she said
New York has num mandates for health plans such as requirements to cover chiropractic care and mammograms Moran said
The association doesnt think the federal law will be as beneficial as it was laid out to be Moran said
The group is working with policymakers to make sure it is implemented in a way that will benefit New York and New Yorkers and there is a role for health plans to continue delivering health care especially to the people who currently rely on those plans she said
Members of the National Federation of Independent Business in New York have identified the cost of health insurance as their No
num concern for the last num years or so said Mike Elmendorf New York director of the group
Small businesses pay more dont get the same coverage as larger groups have fewer options and are dealing with dozens of mandates Elmendorf said
That coupled with tax hikes on health insurance and a poor economy has not helped he said
For small businesses chances are in the past few years that sales are down taxes are up and there are doubledigit insurance increases Elmendorf said
Unfortunately you can decide that when somethings got to give its health insurance he said
Members of the state Business Council have also placed the cost of health insurance at the top of their list of concerns spokesman Michael Moran said
The national Tax Foundation recently ranked New York last out of all states for its business climate and New York has been hit harder by the recession in many ways than other states he said
So theyre already trying to do business in a very highcost and hostile environment in New York and theres only so many dollars they can generate at a time when business is flat or down he said
These are some of the New York State Health Foundation surveys findings
Annual premiums for family coverage sponsored by New York employers averaged nearly $num in num

New York Sen Charles Schumer is urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the marketing of flavored alcoholic beverages with caffeine that appear to be explicitly designed to attract underage drinkers
In a letter to FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz Schumer said Sunday that the colorful cans are also designed to befuddle parents and police with labels that resemble nonalcoholic energy drinks
He said popular drinks such as Joose and Four Loko also use very small print to disclose alcohol content of up to num percent about twice that of beer
Michael Mikhail chief executive of United Brands Co of La Mesa Calif which makes Joose said the company markets nationally through beer distributors and target consumers who can drink alcohol legally
We dont condone nontraditional marketing
We position our product toward at least the age of num and older Mikhail said
We do not target college kids
Schumer a New York Democrat sees it differently
He said numounce cans of Four Loko and Joose are designed to appear hip with flashy colors and funky designs with appeal to younger consumers
They come in flavors such as grape and orange and can cost as little as $num a can
Calls to Phusion Projects Inc of Chicago maker of Four Loko were not immediately returned
In num AnheuserBusch InBev NV and MillerCoors LLC stopped selling caffeinated alcoholic beverages including Tilt and Sparks under pressure from several states and federal regulators but smaller companies continued to sell such products and have since increased sales
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said earlier investigations showed the big companys beverages were aggressively marketed to a younger crowd
Last November the US Food and Drug Administration notified more than two dozen manufacturers of caffeinated alcoholic beverages that it has never specifically approved the addition of caffeine to alcoholic drinks and began studying whether it is unsafe and should be outlawed
The agency noted the mixs growing popularity among up to num percent of college students and its potential health and safety issues
They included a Wake Forest University study that students who combine caffeine and alcohol are likelier to suffer alcoholrelated injuries than those drinking alcohol without caffeine
It is my understanding that caffeineinfused flavored malt beverages are becoming increasingly popular among teenagers Schumer wrote in his letter Sunday
The style and promotion of these products is extremely troubling
Frankly it looks to me as if manufacturers are trying to mislead adults and business owners who sell these products while at the same time actively courting underage drinkers
This type of marketing is at minimum grossly irresponsible
In num the FTC investigated the marketing of flavored malt beverages and the impact on underage drinkers and found most complying with industry codes for ad placement targeting adults
Schumer says that manufacturers since have continued to push new products in new ways that arguably cross the line by targeting younger consumers
FTC spokeswoman Betsy Lordan said the agency has continued to investigate complaints against beverage makers including a num settlement with Constellation Brands over its advertising that consumers of the caffeinated alcohol drink Wide Eyes will remain alert
The FTC said there was no scientific evidence to support the claim

An investor in The Childrens Place Retail Stores Inc is asking the retailers board to look at a merger or other strategic alternatives as competition in the childrens clothing category heats up
Galt Investment Partners LP said Friday that while it is generally pleased with the operational performance of the retailer over the past year or so it feels the board may not be maximizing shareholders value

The head of a failed New Hampshire mortgage firm who pleaded guilty to defrauding investors out of millions of dollars said Wednesday he never believed the company would collapse
I didnt see the company going down
It was a selfdelusion said Scott Farah who testified at a hearing called by Secretary of State Bill Gardner to learn more about the fall of Financial Resources Mortgage which went bankrupt in November num
Farah num said he was in debt and was borrowing money that belonged to the investors
to keep the firm afloat
Farah who was promising investors high returns for money loaned for commercial and residential real estate deals said in num he was expecting financial backing on a project that would have helped but fell through
I always thought it was going to pull out he said of the firm
I didnt believe it was going to collapse until it actually did
It was the first time Farah spoke publicly about the firms demise which has resulted in two department head resignations four major investigations and became part of a US Senate campaign
Farah pleaded guilty to mail fraud and wire fraud in October
Although he could face up to nearly num years in prison when he is sentenced in January prosecutors indicated he has been cooperative and could get less time
On Wednesday hearing officer Charles Chandler said Farah came voluntarily and did not need to be subpoenaed
Farah has admitted pooling investor funds to pay off other loans investors and personal expenses
Authorities called it a Ponzi scheme saying he defrauded at least num investors of at least $num million
When asked what led to the failure of the firm and a secondary company used to service the loans Farah said it was due to the poor economy the downturn in the real estate market
which he thought would recover
and the fact that I took on way too much of the losses
Farah also was involved in realestate deals on his own that failed or werent fully completed
I was FRM and FRM was me he said referring to Financial Resources Mortgage
When asked though about a number of transactions and documents Farah said he couldnt remember because he didnt have the paperwork in front of him
On Tuesday Farahs assistant Donald Dodge
who also faces sentencing for fraud
testified that he put his trust in Farah and didnt realize the business was in trouble until shortly before it collapsed
Dodge said he set up a line of credit for Farah to close loans not realizing he shouldnt have allowed him to borrow from it taking other peoples money
Farah said he believed that Dodge set up the line of credit to help get the ship righted and knew that some transactions did not have the necessary financial backing
For three weeks Chandler has been taking testimony from numerous victims who lost money through loans that never closed
He referred to one woman a refugee from Bosnia who along with her husband lost $num
He asked Farah if he recalled telling the couple such statements as You can never lose your principal No one has ever lost anything or You will never lose your capital
Farah said he didnt recall
A group of investors who attended the hearing were angry and disappointed with Farahs testimony
Arnold Olsen who at num returned to ministering at the Congregational Church of Goffstown after losing his savings said Farah has a selective amnesia on certain matters yet remembered others clearly
I would have pressed him had I been chairing this meeting Olsen said
Susan McIlvene of Kittery Maine who along with her husband Al who lost nearly $num through the firm said many investors have just had enough
Theyve come to the realization theyve lost their money and theyve got to move on with their life
And its too stressful for a lot of people
Widespread low levels of manmade chemicals used to produce nonstick cookware and breathable waterproof clothing have been detected in Washington water and fish according to a Department of Ecology study released Tuesday
Ecology officials said the results confirm what they suspected about perfluorinated compounds known as PFCs and will help the state come up with a plan to reduce the toxic persistent chemicals and their risk to residents
We dont have manufacturers of these chemicals in Washington yet the Washington environment sees them anyway said Carol Kraege who is leading the agencys Toxics Reduction Initiative
Where is it coming from
she said adding the next step will be to determine the sources of PFCs and develop an action plan that could lead to future restrictions
PFCs are toxic longlasting and can build up in the food chain
They have unique chemical properties that make them useful for numerous industrial and consumer applications such as stain and waterrepellant coatings
Until this study there was little data about PFCs in Washington or the Western states said study coauthor Chad Furl an Ecology scientist
The effort is part of a larger initiative to reduce the amount of toxic threats in Washington
The state has already passed among the nations toughest laws for PBDEs or polybrominated diphenyl ethers flame retardants used in upholstered furniture and home electronics
State scientists found low levels of PFCs in water surface samples in lakes and rivers across Washington even pristine areas as well as in fish tissues and discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants
However they found elevated levels of PFCs in osprey eggs taken from nests along the lower Columbia River
Ospreys eat fish and are a top predator and scientists wanted to see whether PFCs were accumulating in fish or fisheating birds Furl said
A type of PFC perfluorooctane sulfonate was detected in osprey eggs at concentrations higher than surface waters and fish showing how powerful PFCs can build up in the food chain he said
The human health risks of PFCs are unclear but the Environmental Protection Agency has found that one type of PFC perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA causes developmental and other adverse effects in laboratory animals
PFCs also have been detected in underground water supplies polar ice caps wildlife and people state officials said

Glenn McCullough Jr has been named chairman of Meridian Powers biomass operations in the US where the Londonbased company plans to build its first power plant
The company in announcing McCulloughs hiring in a statement Monday said Mississippi would be the location for the plant although no site has been chosen
The company said the plant would be one of the plant one of six num to nummegawatt largescale biomassfired power plants it wants to build in the Southeast
Meridian Power is looking into using virgin woodchip as feedstock for its power plants according to the companys website
McCullough is the former mayor Tupelo and former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority
A selfdescribed sullen mope he spends his days slinging coffee in a grubby cafe and his nights laboring over quietly earnest short fiction that goes roundly ignored by editors and agents
He came to the city with big dreams but instead finds himself a spectator to the New York literary scene whose current darling is Blade Markham purported exgangbanger and author of a bestselling street memoir believed by some to be fabricated
Minots failure seems complete when his stunning Romanian girlfriend wins entry to the literary inner circle with an acclaimed book of her own and she leaves him for Markham
In the throes of his misery Minot is approached by Jed Roth a suave stranger with a plan too outrageous to succeed but too delicious to ignore Repackage Roths rejected crime novel as Minots memoir
Given publishers intense appetite for largerthanlife true stories the manuscript cant miss Roth says

Obviously things dont play out that simply and thats where the plot thickens
As the scheme develops Minots life grows so hectic that it comes to resemble the one detailed in his fraudulent memoir
The events that befall him become so incredible
that by the time his adventure rumbles to its inevitable conclusion its impossible to believe a word he says
And that is likely the point

Informed by the scandal of James Freys A Million Little Pieces and other contemporary literary fakes Langers novel takes aim at the hypocrisy of publishers so eager to market fact that they encourage authors to lie
In that regard The Thieves of Manhattan may be to publishing what Joseph Hellers Catchnum was to the military

You have all these things happening
Clyburn said there are historic parallels to what happened on Tuesday
After Congress passed Social Security in the nums and civil rights legislation in the nums Democrats lost ground as Republicans came into office promising to dismantle the laws
After they passed civil rights legislation Democrats got wiped out in the South just like they got wiped out this time Clyburn said

We had the same kind of reactions to health care as we got to civil rights and that you got to Social Security

Excuse me Ms Shriver I wonder what you and Kiva are doing to partner with other microfinance institutions is there an opportunity to partner with us

Klein soon learned she was onto something that none of the worlds top peertopeer lending organizations had quite figured out
Kiva Lending Club Opportunity Fund and Prosper are international or national in scope using the Internet to match investors with entrepreneurs theyd likely never meet

Investors would be so intertwined with the entrepreneurs theyd fund that theyd patronize their businesses become mentors and friends
I know how strong my community is when people know each other Klein said of Cincinnati
Her belief The more hightouch you are the better the chances of protecting your investment

German prosecutors are investigating whether negligent manslaughter was involved in the deaths of num people killed in a crush at the Love Parade techno festival
But amid a clamor of questions about who is to blame they said Monday they havent yet identified any suspects
The tragedy Saturday happened near a tunnel that was the only entrance to the festival grounds in the western industrial city of Duisburg
Police said that in all num people were injured
one of whom was still in lifethreatening condition Monday
It remains unclear what triggered the panic but it appears that people trying to escape the surging crowd climbed up a metal stairway in front of the tunnel and then fell into the crowd and were trampled or crushed
The investigations are concentrating on the allegation of negligent manslaughter and negligent bodily harm said Rolf Haferkamp a spokesman for Duisburg prosecutors
They are not directed against any concrete person at present
A union representing German police has blamed organizers and officials in Duisburg
But witnesses also have pointed the finger at police and private security staff saying the panic broke out after they closed one end of a tunnel
when the festival grounds became too full
Police denied that and said they actually opened a second exit to disperse the masses before the accident happened

One key question whether the venue an old freight railway station that local media estimated could handle num people was suitable for the event

Haferkamp the prosecutors spokesman didnt confirm that
The area was not large enough right from the start thats what I think Duisburg resident Kurt Moczko said
I just cant imagine how this area should be sufficient for num million people
Carsten Schroeter another Duisburg resident echoed that sentiment
I think it is not right to simply blame the police because I think the planning ahead of the event should have been different he said
The state of North RhineWestphalia where Duisburg is located on Monday ordered flags flown at halfstaff on public buildings
Police said that of the num people who were hospitalized after the accident all but num had been released

Mark Twain paid a surprise visit to the Kennedy Center on Tuesday night to honor Tina Fey with the nations top humor prize that bears his name
A mustached Alec Baldwin playing Twain said he thought he would be remembered for being a tender lover and was surprised to learn the prize honors top comics
Tina well thats a funny name for a man he said shocked to hear it was a woman who had won because their brains arent shaped right
A hundred years after the authors death the woman famous for her Emmy Awardwinning impression of Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live accepted the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor
even though she feels her style is so typically Austrian
She thanked Palin for her success and said she has it on good authority that Sen John McCain has a picture of Fey in his office and had been getting ideas long before he picked the former Alaska governor as his running mate
I guess what Im saying is this whole thing might be my fault she said
She also thanked the Kennedy Center which she said will soon be known as the tea party bowling alley and rifle range
SNL comics lined up to celebrate their colleagues work over nine seasons
They played clips from her time anchoring Weekend Update and some of the commercials she wrote including a spoof on mom jeans
Amy Poehler recalled meeting Fey back when they were both part of The Second City improv group in Chicago in the nums
Our dreams were as big as our unshaped eyebrows Poehler said
The humor prize honors those who define contemporary comedy
Last year it went to Bill Cosby
Organizers said Fey made her mark as the first female head writer on SNL not to mention her Palin impression and creating the NBC comedy series num Rock in which she stars with Baldwin
especially that Fey was the first woman to lead the writing team
I was the first male cast member who tried to force an unwanted kiss on the first female head writer he said
At num Fey is the youngest to be honored with the award that was created in num
Shes also only the third woman to receive it after Lily Tomlin and Whoopi Goldberg
Earlier when the prize was announced Fey hinted she didnt feel worthy joking that she assumed Betty White was disqualified for steroid use
Not to be outdone on the red carpet the numyearold White praised Feys intelligence and her sense of comedy
Then she deadpanned Too bad shes not good looking
White also took the stage to honor Fey
They also performed together on SNL in May for which White won rave reviews as host
Steve Martin who also has taken home the award said Feys win means hes been demoted
He said he loves Feys parody of Palin but even more he said he loves to read her writing
Isnt it refreshing to find a comedian who is both really good and funny looking
On the big screen Fey recently starred with Steve Carell in Date Night and is a featured voice in Megamind which debuted at No
num at last weekends box office
Now she is working on her first book a memoir due out next year
She lives in New York with her husband Jeff Richmond and their daughter
SNLs Fred Armisen said one of his favorite things about Fey is her take on the world
She makes fun of people really well
Its so funny so sharp

Breeding pairs of osprey were invited to Thurston Countys Glacial Heritage Prairie Preserve on Wednesday just in time for the nesting season
A joint project between Puget Sound Energy and The Nature Conservancy involves placing four nesting platforms on numfoot utility poles at the numacre nature preserve close to the Black River where the birds are known to fish for food
The goal is to discourage the regal white and black raptors from nesting and perching on power poles lines and transformers serving the neighboring Weyerhaeuser Mima Nursery
The osprey caused three power outages at the nursery last summer and placed their lives at risk trying to build nests on the utility poles said Mel Walters the manager of Puget Sound Energys avian protection program
When the osprey return in the next few weeks from their winter stomping grounds in Mexico they will find new safer nesting habitat awaiting them closer to the river
The osprey nesting platforms are a welcome addition to the nature preserve providing muchneeded breeding sites that fit with construction of other artificial nest sites for bats owls purple martins and Western bluebirds at the prairie preserve said Grace Diehl Thurston County prairie land steward for The Nature Conservancy
Theres no guarantee the osprey will use the manmade nests but Walters said hed be surprised if they werent occupied within two years
Puget Sound Energy the states largest investorowned utility spent about $num last year in its ninecounty service area to reduce bird crashes and electrocutions
A fullblown avian protection program was launched by the utility about num years ago
Were trying to make sure we are in compliance with birdprotection laws and we are trying to protect our system Walters a biologist said
Its the right thing to do and its not a waste of money
Outages and equipment damage from birds can cost tens of thousands of dollars per incident
The utility responds to about num to num bird fatalities involving its powersupply system each year
Puget Sound Energy has completed about num retrofit projects on power lines and utility poles to protect birds from electrocutions and crashes including metal triangles placed on utility pole cross arms to keep osprey from perching on poles at the Weyerhaeuser nursery and line markers
Flappers also were installed on utility lines in Skagit Valley to make lines more visible to wintering snow geese and swans
The utility has built more than num nest platforms for osprey including those installed Wednesday at the prairie preserve by a utility contract crew from Sumnerbased Potelco Inc
Despite all the efforts the utility logged more than num largebird deaths from electrocutions and crashes from num through num including num swans num bald eagles num hawks and num owls
In some cases utilities that fail to take bird protection seriously pay dearly
PacifiCorp utility operations in Wyoming agreed to pay $num million in fines restitution and equipment upgrade costs last year after federal prosecutors determined the utility failed to take steps to reduce golden eagle and other migratory bird deaths as required by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act
This is a big issue for a lot of utilities Walters said

His apprehension had nothing to do with farming and everything to do with meeting someone new
He was about to participate in an event called weed dating a meetup for single farmers looking for a date or a mate
Weed dating is a variation on speed dating in which participants meet in pairs for a few minutes typically in a bar or restaurant and then move on to another rapid pairing
It was the brainchild of Jean and Wendy Palthey who have farmed in Tunbridge for num years
We have this one young guy who works for us Jean Palthey says and hes single and lives in Chelsea and we were joking that there are not a lot of young single people around here so we came up with this idea
Much weeding but no weddings yet
Weed dating takes place on farms among rows of sprouting produce
Participants weed a row with a potential romantic interest then move on to another row and another partner
At the end of the day some people might have cultivated a mutual interest and no matter the field is freshly weeded
The Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont which organized this inaugural series says its the first of its kind in the nation
Itd be really neat to meet a woman says Wolfe num of North Tunbridge
But Im not pressuring myself
Im just thinking that you get to meet people while you help out a local farm weeding
It says something about people that theyd like to do something like this
Three weeddating events have happened so far two in August and one in September
Another at an orchard in Shelburne Vt is set later this month
Twelve people participated in the first four of them men and eight women the second plagued by rain drew four men and one woman and the third attracted six women and one man says Caitlin Gildrien outreach coordinator for the group
To NOFAs knowledge Gildrien says no romantic connections have occurred among the weeders
Were finding that the focus is less on finding a love match than on finding people who share the same interests and values she says
The event sounds good to Julie Roop coordinator of the Young Farmers and Ranchers program of the American Farm Bureau in Washington even though she has never heard of such a thing
Its important to join groups or organizations that have people with the same passion that you do she says
Her program aimed at farmers and ranchers ages num to num has led to love connections between a few participants even though thats far from the groups main mission she says
Sometimes singles whose lives are outdoors have trouble meeting other singles because theyre not working a typical numtonum MondayFriday schedule Roop says
Brandon Moore director of the Alabama Young Farmers Association calls the weeddating idea very interesting
I have noticed in my work with young farmers that many have a tendency to marry early but the ones that do not seem to marry much later in life he says
Its kind of an eitheror thing
Participants in the Vermont weeddating series pay $num for the privilege of meeting and weeding
Those in the inaugural event ranged in age from early nums to num
Each wore a name tag with his or her first name and the name of a favorite fruit or vegetable which became a weeddating surname
It isnt only about love and dating its also about making friends and community coorganizer Sarah Kale Heusner told participants before the weeding began
Beyond rows of plump onions and a field of corn that rustled in the light breeze the group got down to the business
As the pulled weeds piled up snippets of conversation floated from heads bent companionably close together
They ranged from the standard Where did you grow up
What do you do for a living
to discussions about gardening and farming educating kids about where food comes from energy policy and bartering as a better economic model for the world
At intervals of about seven minutes a small goat bell rang and everyone got up shook muddy hands and moved a row over to a new weeding companion
Caitlin Henzler num who works as an apprentice farmer in Chesterfield Mass roadtripped to Vermont with a friend for the event
Ive been weeding for the past month and half so you might wonder why I want to spend time off weeding
But I thought Why not
I like to weed with people
People always have something to share
Henzler says shes looking for a very specific thing in a romantic partner and the farming community is where I think Ill find that
There are a lot of young farmers out there but farmers dont get out that often
Josh Schlossberg num of East Montpelier Vt who weeded with Henzler one round adds Its better to meet people over shared interests and physically doing something
Ive done online dating but this is the first time Ive done something like this where you meet multiple people
Speed dating is too blatant

Central Vermont Public Service Corp says it plans to buy twothirds of electricity generated by a proposed wind turbine project in Readsboro and Searsburg
The project would start operating in num
The Deerfield Wind project would include num wind turbines seven in Readsboro and eight in Searsburg to produce enough to power about num homes in Vermont for a year
It would be built by Iberdola Renewables
Vermont law requires energy suppliers to find new renewable power sources to provide at least num percent of the states energy by num

With authorities closing in to seize num marijuana plants on John Robert Boones farm two years ago the legendary Kentucky outlaw vanished like a puff of smoke
The prolific grower has been dodging the law ever since his folkhero status growing with every sale of a Run Johnny Run Tshirt and click on his Facebook fan page
Tracking down the fugitive who resembles a tattooed Santa Claus has proven as hard as trying to catch a ghost for the federal authorities canvassing tightlipped residents among the small farms in a rural area southeast of Louisville
Boone whos trying to avoid the life sentence he would get if convicted a third time of growing pot has plenty of sympathizers in an area where many farmers down on their luck have planted marijuana
Thats all hes ever done raising pot said longtime friend Larry Hawkins who owns a bar and restaurant called Hawks Place
As Hawkins puts it there are two kinds of growers Youve got the caught and the uncaught
And at least for now the numyearold Boone is a bit of both
He spent more than a decade in federal prison after being convicted in the late nums of taking part in what federal prosecutors called the largest domestic marijuana syndicate in American history a string of num farms in Minnesota Illinois Indiana Kentucky Michigan Nebraska Missouri Kansas and Wisconsin
The group became known as the Cornbread Mafia and Boone was tagged by prosecutors as their leader earning him the nicknames King of Pot and Godfather of Grass
Eventually num Kentuckians were accused of growing num tons of marijuana
Boones looks are a mixture of grandfatherly and sinister Around the time of the num raid on his property num miles southeast of Louisville Boone sported white hair on his balding head and a shaggy white beard
Yet across his back are large tattooed letters spelling Omerta the infamous Sicilian word that describes the underworld code of silence
While federal authorities dont describe him as violent his criminal record dates back to the nums and also includes charges of wanton endangerment and illegal firearm possession
Marshal James Habib and Boones friends call him an innovator
separating male from female plants on a large scale to increase potency and experimenting with seeds from around the world in different climates
There might have been one or two close to him said Jack Smith a former federal prosecutor who represented Boone in the nums case
I never heard of anybody who was bigger
While Smith said some see marijuana growers as harmless he points out largescale operations can fund other illegal activities such as prostitution or lead to violence between dealers
Large marijuana fields in Kentucky and elsewhere are sometimes boobytrapped or patrolled by armed growers
Its illegal for a reason Smith said
dotted with small towns corn fields and bourbon distilleries
have a colorful history of fostering illicit activities
The area was home to moonshine runners during Prohibition who often darted into rows of corn stalks and barns to hide from federal agents
In the early nums as the economy soured and prices for tobacco and farm products dropped parts of central Kentucky had unemployment rates nearing num percent
The rate in the area now is around num percent
similar to the national average
A lot of the sons of moonshine makers turned to marijuana said Smith a native of the area who now practices in Louisville
That particular part of the state that was the hometown of marijuana
Boone himself invoked the areas hardships during the num court hearing at which he was sentenced to num years in prison
With the poverty at home marijuana is sometimes one of the things that puts bread on the table Boone said
We were working with our hands on earth God gave us
Boones estranged wife Marilyn declined to speak to The Associated Press at her house
Other family members also declined to respond to phone calls and letters
And in the towns of central Kentucky
Springfield Raywick Loretto and Lebanon
many people acknowledged knowing of Boone but either professed not to know him well or wouldnt speak about him to a reporter
Even if I knew where he was I wouldnt tell you said James Jim Bean Cecil a numyearold Lebanon Ky resident who spent time in prison with Boone
Those who would talk about Boone offered similar descriptions
a friendly nonconfrontational man who was quick to open his wallet when friends were having trouble making ends meet
For example a man who mowed the grass on Boones sprawling property was given twice the fee he requested at the end of the job
When Cecil got out of prison Boone gave him money to get back on his feet
He never asked me to pay him back Cecil said
Friends also recall him as a heck of a farmer who grew corn and who just happened to also grow marijuana which to some locals made Boone an outlaw not a criminal
A Facebook page set up for him has num fans
He was just a good ol country boy a farmer said Joe Pendleton a Boone acquaintance whose shop sells the Run Johnny Run Tshirts in nearby Campbellsville
Hes not robbing banks or nothing
Boones latest trouble came in num when Kentucky State Police doing aerial surveillance spotted marijuana plants on trailers on Boones farm near Springfield
A raid turned up more than num plants but no Boone
As soon as he found out they were there he split said Jim Higdon a writer based in Lebanon Ky who interviewed Boone for a book project
It was a death sentence
Boone who has marijuanagrowing contacts in Central America could be anywhere
Then again Habib said he could still be hiding out in the rural tightknit area around his farm
Its like trying to catch a ghost former Deputy US
Marshal Rich Knighten said shortly after Boones indictment in num
If Boones friends have their way hell remain uncaught
Some complain its not worth a life sentence
which Boone faces under the federal threestrikes provision
for a nonviolent drug charge
I never seen nobody get mad in my life smoking dope said former Raywick mayor Charlie Bickett who runs Charlies Place a bar filled with handpainted milk cans and saws including a painting of Boone looking out over the water while smoking a joint
Even free Bickett said Boone is serving a sentence
wondering each day if hell be caught and knowing he cant return to his family
I guarantee you hed love to be back home Johnny would Bickett said

Tiffany Beisel didnt like unemployment much
When the Maize High junior got hired at Spangles after num months between jobs she celebrated
I was pretty excited she said
I hadnt worked for a whole year
Last year was a terrible one for teenagers to look for work
only slightly better than num the worst year in five decades

It cant get a whole lot worse
There are no unemployment numbers for teenagers in Wichita or Kansas
But the national unemployment rate for teenagers in March was num percent
For black teens it was num percent
Teens may work cheaply but they face challenges when times get hard and competition with adults gets tight They cant work during school hours and often have little experience and few skills
Wes Hostetler store manager for the Johnsons Garden Center near numst and Woodlawn typically hires teenagers to work parttime shifts at the counter during the busy spring season

Hiring somebody in June means they will leave just when they are getting fully trained
Hannah Christiansen a junior at Maize High has worked at Spangles about a year and a half
I work to have money and to have something to do she said
The reason the outlook is improving this year said Challenger Gray Christmas CEO John Challenger is that consumer spending is inching up
People are starting to go to more movies and going out for dinner a little more often he said

President Barack Obamas Senate allies are taking one last run at advancing whats left of his tattered jobs agenda
The $num billion spending measure would help states and local school boards with their budget problems but its fate is unclear in advance of a key test vote on breaking a GOP filibuster
The idea is that money
$num billion to help states with their Medicaid budgets and $num billion to help school districts avoid teacher layoffs
will help preserve the jobs of public employees giving a boost to the fragile economic recovery
A vote scheduled for Monday was postponed until later this week after an analysis showed the measure would add $num billion to the deficit over the coming decade
Democrats were scrambling to win the votes of Republicans like Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine who provided the key votes last month to pass a sixmonth extension of jobless assistance for the longterm unemployed
The two elements are leftovers from a larger tax and spending measure that in significant measure stalled earlier this summer
The spending is accompanied by tax increases and spending cuts to limit its impact on the budget deficit
Thats a step aimed at mollifying moderate Republicans concerned about record budget deficits
Democrats who control the chamber with num votes will need to pick up at least one Republican to muster the num required to defeat the GOP filibuster
Collins has been a a stout supporter in the past of giving states help with their budgets and was the driving force behind a $num billion aid package enacted in num
But shes undecided so far on her vote a spokesman said citing cuts of unused Pentagon shipbuilding funds
The main reason the measure doesnt balance is that the Congressional Budget Office concluded cutting spending from old appropriations accounts wouldnt save as much as Democrats hoped
Failure to pass the measure would be another rebuff to Obama who requested an extension of additional aid for the Medicaid program in his budget and has belatedly rallied behind the money for teachers as well
Without the help states will be left with a huge hole in their own budgets while school systems would have to make greater layoffs than anticipated
We will vote to keep teachers and firefighters and policemen from being laid off in a fiscally responsible way said Majority Leader Harry Reid DNev
Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky criticized the measure saying it is a payoff to public employee unions a key Democratic constituency
Our friends on the other side are now in the business of paying for states to hire more workers even if they cant afford it on their own McConnell said
It creates a permanent need for future state bailouts at a time when we can least afford it
The measure would be financed with about $num billion in tax hikes that limit the ability of some USbased multinational companies to use foreign tax credits to reduce their US taxes
It would also rescind about $num billion in previously appropriated money and save num billion by curbing future food stamp benefits
What voters had to say after casting ballots in North Dakotas general election on Tuesday
Sid Kadrmas num a blackjack dealer from Mandan arrived at her polling site wearing a Tshirt that said Im a Democrat because I think and because I care
Kadrmas opposed setting aside a Legacy Fund savings account for oil tax money

Oil field workers need a place to live
Thats what we do in this state
take care of one another

Tom Rausch num a financial analyst from Bismarck said he hasnt missed voting in an election since he was num
Rausch worried about the skyrocketing federal deficit and believed Rep Earl Pomeroy was partly to blame for supporting federal health care legislation which was opposed by many North Dakotans

Its a fair assumption I didnt vote for Pomeroy
If they dont listen to the people when the people speak then they need to be replaced
Dan Wanek num a computer systems engineer from Bismarck said he came to the polls to help support incumbent Democratic Rep Earl Pomeroy who was in a tight race with Republican challenger Rick Berg
Wanek said hes a lifelong hunter but voted in favor of Measure num which sought to ban biggame hunting within fenced enclosures

Cathy Bliss num of McKenzie a minister at the First Presbyterian church in Wilton said she voted for incumbent Democratic Rep Earl Pomeroy over his Republican challenger Rick Berg
Bliss backed Pomeroys support of federal health care legislation an issue Berg used to pummel the incumbent during the campaign
Pomeroy did vote for the health bill and I think he should have promoted that more because I think thats a good vote Bliss said
I think hes got a good idea of what is going on in North Dakota
Hes got a good long family history here
Shane Holmstrom num of Bismarck a sales manager for a farm machinery leasing company said he voted for Berg because I really didnt like the way Pomeroy voted on a lot of issues
I didnt feel it coincided with North Dakota
The federal health care legislation is probably my biggest objection to Pomeroys voting record Holmstrom said
I think its time for a change he said

The Dark Knight Rises is due in theaters July num num
Bucking Hollywoods current wave of numD movies Nolan is not planning to shoot the film in numD
Warner Bros had agreed with Nolans argument that the sequel should resist the numD craze the director told the Los Angeles Times Hero Complex blog which first reported the title

Algerias telecommunications minister says the country has the right to be protectionist and reinstate state monopolies to defend its interests
regardless of whether that scares off foreign investors
Moussa Benhamadi told Alger Chaine III radio that its the Algerian governments sovereign right to make these decisions and that it can decide on protectionist measures when circumstances require them
The ministers comments reported Friday referred to a plan announced by the government to preempt the sale of the countrys main cell phone operator Djezzy owned by the Egyptian firm Orascom Telecom
The buyout would recreate a state telecommunications monopoly in Algeria after a decade of painstaking efforts to liberalize the largely governmentrun economy
The row between Algerias government and Orascom Telecom became public this spring after the Algerian football team was harassed by Egyptian supporters in Cairo
Orascoms owner Naguib Sawiris said earlier this week he hadnt heard from Algerian authorities since they blocked negotiations for Orascom to sell Djezzy to the South African firm MTN
Sawiris values Orascom telecoms Algerian subsidiary at US$num billion to US$num billion
Benhamadi said Algerian government experts will take their time to study the issue and wont be pressed into a fixed deadline to respond
The Djezzy sale issue is too sensitive to be handled by his ministry alone and is being overseen directly by the prime ministers office he said
Benhamadi became telecommunications minister last week after his predecessor was fired largely because of his handling of the Djezzy issue
The possible buyout has several independent media outlets wondering whether Algeria is reverting to its long history of statecontrolled economy
The Algerian state derives large revenues from oil and gas but has been struggling to attract foreign investors or tourists
It enforced a new law retroactive to the num fiscal year that largely bans foreign firms from repatriating benefits earned by their subsidiaries in Algeria
MANUFACTURING BENEFIT Reports of improved manufacturing activity in China and the United States boosted oil and energy products as well as most industrial metals
DOLLARS IMPACT The dollar grew weaker against other currencies
Since commodities are priced in dollars a weaker dollar makes them more of a bargain for buyers using other currencies
Now the system cant even count on that
Senate Democratic leaders scrapped the $num trillion bill late Thursday after determining they couldnt muster enough support to bring the measure to the floor for a vote
Critics including South Dakota Republican Sen Jon Thune said the bill was too expensive and packed with pork projects the nation couldnt afford
Lawmakers instead will kick the issue over to next year to a more conservative Congress that has vowed to tighten belts
Troy Larson Lewis Clarks executive director said its more bad news for a project that has had to scratch and claw every year just to get close to the amount it originally was promised
Even though the $num million was far less than the $num million sought for the project serving Sioux Falls and parts of two other states at least managers knew what was coming
Or they thought they did
The challenge is we have further uncertainty as to when any decision will be made about funding and theres a good likelihood we could get less than seven Larson said Friday
It really puts us on hold
And its not just Lewis Clark
The earmarked project was one of more than num left in limbo because the bill has been pulled
That includes dozens in South Dakota totaling more than $num million from $num for a dialysis unit for the Yankton Sioux tribe to $num million for the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System in southwestern South Dakota
There was also money for an aircraft maintenance facility at Joe Foss Field improvements to a number of roads across the state and research money for the states universities
That doesnt automatically mean they wont be in the num spending bill that the next Congress will take up at some point
South Dakota Democratic Sen Tim Johnson who sponsored most of the states earmarks in the nowdefunct spending bill said the Democraticcontrolled Senate still could insist on including earmarks and the issue would have to be resolved in budget negotiations with the House
Earmarks had been targeted in recent weeks by Republicans including former supporters such as Thune who said the nations mounting debt and the results of a historic election that swept tea partybacked candidates into office helped to sway them
Im pleased that Republicans stood together to stop this $num trillion numpage spending bill from passing
Instead of continuing the old Washington way of doing business we must listen to the concerns expressed by voters this past Election Day Thune said in a statement issue Friday
Johnson said he was disappointed that Republicans forced the bills demise saying it leaves decisions on which projects deserve money to nameless faceless bureaucrats in Washington
And Larson doesnt think Lewis Clark will get a better shake from those bureaucrats
In the last three administration proposed budgets the project got nothing in num $num million in num and $num million in the num proposed budget
That only keeps the lights on Larson said of the $num million figure
We dont get any work done

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed num percent last month its strongest onemonth gain in a year
Its not yet clear whether Fridays downturn was a sign of more trouble to come or just a temporary setback on a generally upward trajectory for the market
If stocks are going to get more fuel to advance they will have to get it from someplace other than earnings since the corporate reporting season is winding down
That leaves the focus on the economy and the news there has been discouraging
Housing retail sales personal income and now jobs reports have all been downbeat
The monthly jobs report from the Labor Department is a key indicator on the health of the economy and is closely watched by investors and economists
Job creation has a huge effect on the rest of the economy influencing how much people spend on cars clothes travel and even homes
The latest report confirmed that many employers are still reluctant to hire
The tension will play out for the rest of the year between corporate earnings and employment said Sarah Hunt a research analyst at Alpine Funds
At some point Hunt said earnings will have to slow to match the weaker economy or employment will have to pick up to help maintain strong earnings

A candidate for attorney general said Monday the office has the power to investigate and reform how wholesale electricity rates are set in New York a process that he said now costs consumers $num billion a year too much
Richard Brodsky an assemblyman long critical of utility deregulation said the socalled market clearing price set by the New York Independent System Operator has pushed New Yorks electric rates to the fourth highest in the nation
Consumer groups have long questioned the industrycreated ISOs practice of setting the price at the highest bidders rather than lowest in a complex formula for setting rates
Every day New Yorkers pay tens of millions of extra dollars because of this one organization Brodsky said
It seems to me we have this gigantic ripoff going on with the attorney general uniquely postured to go after the problem
The Westchester County Democrat whose Assembly committee reported last year that the system allows power plant operators to reap excessive profits at ratepayers expense said he hasnt asked Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to investigate
But he promised he would open a probe if elected
Brodsky is one of six candidates for attorney general
Aside from him none of them has focused on this issue
In an accompanying white paper Brodsky said the daily auction involving utility companies and power generators fixes the price of electricity at the highest possible cost
Calls to Cuomo and the ISO for comment were not immediately returned Monday
The attorney general has oversight of notforprofit corporations which Cuomo has used in investigating state Sen Pedro Espadas Soundview health care clinic in the Bronx
Brodsky who proposed legislation to reregulate the market to include some direct government oversight of electricity ratesetting and monitoring said an investigation also should look into excessive NYISO salaries
The statewide power grid operator is paying its directors $num a year for a numhour work week he said and most employees get num percent bonuses while executives get close to num percent
The ISO has administered the market and its prices since deregulation in num
Operators have said their process allows power producers to submit bids on a price for the megawatt hours available at a specific time
Those prices range from zero for producers with excess power to unload to $num per unit
The ISO could choose the lowest bidder but when that generators units are expended the ISO moves to the next highest bidders in order until all the megawatts needed are secured
Each time the ISO moves to a higher bidder all the lower bidders are paid the price offered in the highest bid used
The white paper cites a num report by energy analyst Robert McCullough who looked at the NYISO and found that every day at least one producer submits maximum $num bids while production costs even with expensive fuels like natural gas are significantly less than $num an hour
This high bidding illustrates that generators are gaming the market or intentionally withholding power to create a price spike or artificial scarcity McCullough wrote
Gavin Donohue chief executive of the Independent Power Producers of New York said the McCullough report was flawed based on the three highest years of natural gas prices and a small number of energy generators
The price for wholesale electricity rates are at the lowest level theyve been in num years he said
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversees New Yorks wholesale market rules and many commodities like milk and coffee beans also use the mechanism of a uniform clearing price Donohue said
Whats raising electricity rates is the stuff that Assemblyman Brodsky is championing the impact of environmental regulations and taxes and fees people pay on their bills
Its processor works num times slower than the Apple iPad but the first ever Apple computer has sold for num times the price
The Apple I one of only num such models ever made was sold Tuesday afternoon at Christies auction house in central London for num pounds about $num
It came with its original packaging and a signed sales letter from Steve Jobs one of Apple Computers cofounders and the current CEO of Apple Inc
When the Apple I was introduced in num it was the only personal computer to come with a fully assembled motherboard making it ready to use straight from the box
provided the user supplied a keyboard power supply and display Christies said
It sold for $num and was available until it was discontinued in num
Bidding on the Apple I came quickly with the computer eventually going to Italian businessman and private collector Marco Boglione who made his offer over the phone
Marcos brother Francesco Boglione who attended the auction in person told The Associated Press that Marcos purchase was a testament to his love of computers
The first time I had heard of the idea of a personal computer it was from Marco Boglione said
He bought it because he loves computers
Present at the technology auction which aslo included manuscripts prints and sciencethemed texts was Apple Computer cofounder Steve Wozniak who agreed to add an autographed letter to the lot
He said the auction was a historic moment for his work especially when sold alongside such other technological greats as an Enigma the German codemaking machine and writings of British mathematician Alan Turing considered one of the founders of modern computing
Today my heart went out as I got to see things auctioned off like the Turing documents and the Enigma machine
and the Apple I Wozniak told journalists after the auction
It really was an important step even though I didnt feel that way when I designed it
Im very delighted for the gentleman who purchased it he added
Boglione said his brothers newly purchased Apple I would likely be returned to working condition
and eventually join a collection of Apple computers
Inside the auction house Tuesday afternoon many patrons studied the sale catalog using Apples iPads and iPhones
a sign of the times said Christies Julian Wilson
It is a fitting illustration of how computers have revolutionized the world he said
The US will provide training to the Nigerian military and police to professionalize forces in the West African country that is a major US crude oil supplier a State Department official said Wednesday
William Fitzgerald a deputy assistant secretary of state told reporters during a conference call Wednesday that the training would help ensure security in the OPECmember nation
Fitzgerald also said a recent governmentsponsored amnesty program for militants in the countrys oilrich Niger Delta appears to be working
Still Fitzgerald said more needs to be done to ensure exfighters receive honest wages rather than continue attacks against oil pipelines or politicians in the runup to Nigerias January elections
The Niger Delta is blessed with resources but cursed with low development Fitzgerald said
Fitzgerald said the training also would include teaching the countrys Economic and Financial Crimes Commission its antigraft police
However the diplomat offered no other details about the program
Nigeria has been a major world oil producer for the last num years with foreign oil firms like Royal Dutch Shell PLC French major Total Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp exploring the Niger Delta and off the countrys coastline
Yet despite billions coming into the government from oil sales the delta remains a poor region beset by pollution and little opportunity for its citizens
Upset by the spills and the regions unceasing poverty militants in the delta have targeted pipelines kidnapped petroleum company workers and fought government troops since num
That violence drastically cut Nigerias crude production to the rest of the world causing spikes to the global oil prices in the past
That violence drastically subsided after a governmentsponsored amnesty deal last year which provided cash payoffs for fighters and the promise of job training
However many exfighters now complain that the government has failed to fulfill its promises
Meanwhile thieves continue to break into pipelines to steal crude oil to sell on the black market
California lawmakers advanced several bills Tuesday that would help the state implement national health care reform over the objection of Republicans
The state Senate narrowly approved two bills to set up an insurance exchange that would allow people to shop for health insurance
The exchange would let people compare insurance plans and buy coverage through a consumerfriendly website
Republicans who opposed the bills said the measures could create unaccountable bureaucracy
Sen Bob Dutton RRancho Cucamonga said California should leave it to the federal government to create its own exchange to let people compare and buy insurance coverage
He called the stateoperated exchange a scary proposition
Let the federal government take on the full responsibility for this program said Dutton who is set to take over as Republican leader next month
But Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg DSacramento said opponents should put aside their objections now that the federal health care system has become law
If we dont embrace federal health care reform we are going to be jeopardizing billions of dollars as the state faces a $num billion budget shortfall Steinberg said
Why would we once again turn our backs on the opportunity to draw down billions of dollars in federal funds
SBnum which creates the exchange passed the Senate on a num vote and now goes to the governor for his review
A companion bill that establishes the duties of the exchange ABnum passed on a num roll call and returns to the Assembly for final action
Health care reform advocates praised the Senates actions
This was the big hurdle for the flagship of the health reform bills said Anthony Wright executive director of Health Access
The California exchange will be able to pool the purchasing power of literally millions of Californians to bargain for the best price and value with the insurers
Also on Tuesday the Assembly approved ABnum a bill that would prohibit insurance companies from charging an additional copay for insured patients getting preventive care such as mammograms and cancer screenings
A bankruptcy judge Thursday approved Sea Island Cos plan to sell its luxury resorts golf courses and private clubs for $num million to settle crushing debts that forced the Georgia company to seek protection from lenders

Bill Jones III who will stay on as Sea Islands CEO under the sale terms called it a new beginning for Sea Island and a continuation of our great heritage
The sale will end three generations of Sea Islands ownership by Jones family
I am very pleased that we were able to achieve a consensual plan that addresses the needs and interests of our members guests vendors and our employees who continue to provide the kind of genuine heartfelt service for which Sea Island is so well known Jones said in a statement

Its the best we could do under a difficult and challenging case said Jordi Guso attorney for Sea Islands unsecured creditors

Sarah Borders Sea Islands attorney said the deal provided the highest possible recoveries for creditors

The new owners of Sea Islands four luxury resorts three golf courses and two private clubs will be Oaktree Capital Management of Los Angeles Avenue Capital Group of New York Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich Conn and the Anschutz Corporation of Denver
The courts approval of the deal brings Sea Island a giant step toward emerging from bankruptcy protection three months after it filed under Chapter num
The company says costly upgrades and renovations aimed at attracting wealthier customers followed by a recessiondriven toll on its resort and realestate businesses led to its insolvency
The sale agreement requires Sea Islands new owners to keep its resorts and golf courses open honor existing club memberships and retain the companys num employees
Six former Sea Island executives who were owed more than $num million initially objected to the sale but agreed to let it move forward after company attorneys agreed to continue working on a better settlement for their claims
Dennie McCrary a former Sea Island president said hes confident of a reasonable settlement
Banks with outstanding loans to Sea Island had been on board with the sale since Sea Island reached a prearranged deal with two of its new owners to sell for $num million if its properties didnt fetch a higher price at auction
after the initial bidders opted to partner with two competitors at auction
was nearly $num million higher
That allowed Sea Island to win over unsecured creditors by more than doubling their payout pool from $num million to $num million

Phil Bredesen met one last time with national credit ratings agencies as governor of Tennessee and said hes met his goal of leaving the next administration with an improved bond rating
During a conference call with reporters from New York City on Wednesday Bredesen and Finance and Administration Commissioner Dave Goetz noted the administration started eight years ago with a AA bond rating with a negative outlook but now two out of the three agencies have raised the rating to the highest level
I sort of feel like we started out at the numyard line and now at the numyard line at the other end of the field and Id love to push that last one over but really weve accomplished what weve set out to do he said
Moodys Investor Services recently raised the rating from Aanum to Aaa while Fitch Ratings adjusted the rating from AA to AAA
The Standard Poors rating for Tennessee remains at one notch below the highest Bredesen said

We believe that the last quarter shows were coming back out of this he said
We have projected in our fiveyear budget a conservative but reasonable revenue growth going forward
Bredesen said he hopes the next governor will stay on the same financial path the state has been on to keep debt low and have good debt coverage
Democrat Mike McWherter and Republican Bill Haslam are running to take over next year when Bredesen leaves office
Certainly both the candidates that are running for governor are both conservativeminded people who would be in that mode he said
But he would advise the next governor to react quickly to changes in the economy
When the economy started to go south there if we had not immediately started cutting we would have been in a lot of trouble by this time he said

The Utah Department of Transportation is set to trade a rich gravel deposit in Tooele County to an excavating company in exchange for a piece of land in the Salt Lake Valley that the state needs for a highway
Its a deal some who live in Tooele County fear will cause environmental problems and the loss of a unique geological feature left behind by Lake Bonneville
Last week the Utah Transportation Commission approved a trade of num acres of stateowned land of the Stockton Bar a gravel berm a couple of miles long a halfmile across and num feet high that was created by Lake Bonneville when it covered much of northern Utah thousands of years ago
The Harper Companies want to mine the gravel
In return company President Rulon Harper has offered num acres of land for the Mountain View highway that would connect the Salt Lake and Utah counties
UDOT says the contract for the land swap hasnt yet been executed
Stockton is in Tooele County about num miles southwest of Salt Lake City by car
Some county officials who have considered creating a Stockton Bar state park have expressed concern
Geologists use the bar to learn about climate change
One geologist calls it the biggest and bestpreserved wavedeposited sandbar in the Western Hemisphere
Its a record of Ice Age history and its not something you can just rebuild or replace said University of Utah geologist Marjorie Chan
Even if the land swap takes place Tooele County Commissioner Jerry Hurst said he and his colleagues have pledged not to rezone the land for mining unless Stockton residents want to
Hurst said neighbors originally united against the proposal because they believe mining could release dust onto nearby homes and could create a wind tunnel between two valleys potentially stirring up contamination from nearby mine tailings
He says opposition appears to have softened with offers Harper is making to the community
Someone who answered the phone Monday at Harper Companies told The Associated Press there was no comment and refused to give her name before hanging up
Stockton resident Kendall Thomas said some people are not opposing the land swap because they think it will eventually happen anyway
I say were not going to lose
We shouldnt do it Thomas said
The transportation commission voted num to approve the land swap
Commission Chairman Jeffrey Holt said the department has a responsibility to get rid of extra properties
He said local officials can decide whether to allow mining
Commissioner Meghan Holbrook of Salt Lake County voted against the trade
We lose a little bit of our heritage every time we lose a geological formation she said

Senator Robert C Byrd who rose from an impoverished childhood in West Virginias coal country to become the longestserving senator in US history died Monday at age num
During his num years in the Senate Byrd used his mastery of the chambers rules and a taste for tough tactics to become a passionate and often feared advocate for the state and the Senate he loved
His white mane stentorian voice and flamboyant speeches citing Roman emperors gave him the presence of a man from a grander distant time
In many ways Byrd embodied the changes the US has undergone in the past half century
A onetime segregationist and opponent of civil rights legislation he evolved into a liberal hero as one of the earliest unrepentant and most vocal foes of the Iraq war and a supporter of the rights of gays to serve openly in the military
As the Senate opened Monday Byrds desk was draped in black cloth with a bowl of white roses
Flags outside the White House and the Capitol flew at halfstaff
Senators who came to the floor to pay tribute recognized both his longevity
he served longer and cast more votes than any senator in history
and the tenacity in which he defended the traditions and prerogatives of the Senate
Senator Byrds ambition was legendary said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid recalling how shortly after he first took his oath of office on January num num he told a local newspaper that he wanted to someday chair the Senate Appropriations Committee
Thirty years later he was
and then lived and served for num more
In many ways a throwback to an era of powerful Senate orators such as Henry Clay or John C Calhoun the stiff and formal Byrd could speak at great length with fire and passion mixing references to the Roman Empire with emotional memories of his almost seven decades with his late wife Erma
Brandishing his copy of the US Constitution that he always carried with him he resisted any attempt to diminish the role of the Senate as in the days leading up to the num invasion of Iraq when he was one of the few to stand up against ceding warmaking powers to President George W Bush
Byrd was equally tireless in steering federal dollars to his state one of the nations poorest and his efforts will live on in the many highways and buildings in West Virginia that carry his name
President Barack Obama said the Senate has lost a venerable institution and America has lost a voice of principle and reason
He held the deepest respect of members of both parties and he was generous with his time and advice something I appreciated greatly as a young senator Obama said in a statement
A spokesman for the family Jesse Jacobs said that Byrd died at about num am at Inova Hospital in Fairfax Virginia where he had been since late last week
Byrd had been in frail health for several years
Byrd was the Senates majority leader for six of the num years he served there and he was third in the line of succession to the presidency behind Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
In its first order of business Monday numyearold Daniel Inouye of Hawaii now in his eighth term was sworn in to replace Byrd in the mostly honorary position of president pro tempore of the Senate
Tributes to the Senates dean lent a somber tone to the first day Monday of Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan
No senator came to care more about the Constitution and be a more effective defender of our constitutional government than the senior senator from West Virginia Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said in his opening remarks
The Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Byrd combined a devotion to the US Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate
We will remember him for his fighters spirit his abiding faith and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes McConnell said
Former President Jimmy Carter said Byrd was my closest and most valuable adviser during his presidency when Byrd served as Senate majority leader
Byrd was instrumental in getting the votes to pass the Panama Canal treaty Carter wanted overcoming strong Republican opposition
Joe Manchin a Democrat will appoint Byrds replacement
Democratic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose confidential conversations said Manchin has told associates in the past he was interested in the seat
The governor told The Associated Press that he will not appoint himself to fill the seat and had no timetable for naming a replacement
Byrd was a master of the Senates bewildering rules and longtime chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee which controls a third of the $num trillion federal budget
He was willing to use both to reward friends and punish those he viewed as having slighted him
Byrd was elected majority leader in num and held the post until Democrats lost control of the Senate four years later
He remained his partys leader through six years in the minority then spent another two years as majority leader
Byrd stepped aside as majority leader in num when Democrats sought a more contemporary television spokesman
His consolation prize was the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee
In num Byrd won an unprecedented ninth term in the Senate just months after surpassing South Carolinian Strom Thurmonds record as its longestserving member
His more than num roll call votes were another record
Byrd seemed to slow after the death of Erma his wife of almost num years in num
Frail and at times wistful he used two canes to walk haltingly
By num aides were bringing him to and from the Senate floor in a wheelchair
In late num he surrendered his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee
Byrds lodestar was protecting the Constitution
He frequently pulled out a dogeared copy of it from a pocket in one of his trademark threepiece suits
He also defended the Senate in its ageold rivalry with the executive branch no matter which party held the White House
Unlike other prominent Senate Democrats such as num presidential nominee John Kerry of Massachusetts who voted to authorize the war in Iraq Byrd stood firm in opposition
and felt gratified when public opinion swung behind him
The people are becoming more and more aware that we were hoodwinked that the leaders of this country misrepresented or exaggerated the necessity for invading Iraq Byrd said
He cited Iraq when he endorsed thenSen Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination in May num calling Obama a shining young statesman who possesses the personal temperament and courage necessary to extricate our country from this costly misadventure
Byrds accomplishments followed a childhood of poverty in West Virginia and his success on the national stage came despite a complicated history on racial matters
As a young man he was a member of the racist Ku Klux Klan for a brief period and he joined Southern Democrats in an unsuccessful filibuster against the landmark num Civil Rights Act
He later apologized for both actions saying intolerance has no place in America
While supporting later civil rights bills he opposed busing to integrate schools
of Congress across a career that began in num with his election to the House of Representatives
He served three terms there before winning his Senate seat in num
In a measure of his tenacity Byrd took a decade of night courses to earn a law degree in num and completed his longdelayed bachelors degree at West Virginias Marshall University in num with correspondence classes
Byrd was a neardeity in economically struggling West Virginia to which he delivered countless federally financed projects such as the FBIs repository for computerized fingerprint records
Robert Carlyle Byrd was born Nov num num in North Wilkesboro North Carolina as Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr the youngest of five children
Before he was num his mother died and his father sent him to live with an aunt and uncle Vlurma and Titus Byrd who renamed him and moved to the coalmining town of Stotesbury West Virginia
Byrds foster father was a miner who frequently changed jobs and Byrd recalled that the familys house was without electricity no running water no telephone a little wooden outhouse
He graduated from high school but could not afford college
Married in num to high school sweetheart Erma Ora James
with whom he had two daughters
he pumped gas cut meat and during World War II was a shipyard welder
Returning to meat cutting in West Virginia he became popular for his fundamentalist Bible lectures
A grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan suggested he run for office
He won his first race
for the states House of Delegates
in num distinguishing himself from num rivals by singing and fiddling mountain tunes
His fiddle became a fixture he later played it on the television show Hee Haw and recorded an album
After six years in the West Virginia legislature Byrd was elected to the US House in num
Byrd entered Congress as one of its most conservative Democrats
He was an early supporter of the Vietnam War
His views gradually moderated particularly on economic issues but he always sided with his states coal interests in confrontations with environmentalists

Donald Trump is suing a south Florida county and its airport to quiet down
A lawsuit filed Monday in Palm Beach County Circuit Court is the latest legal action by Trump in a decadesold disagreement over noise control at Palm Beach International Airport which is near Trumps ritzy MaraLago club
Trump has a home at the club which is open only to members and invited guests
Assistant County Attorney Andrew McMahon declined to comment on pending litigation
The lawsuit also names the airports director Bruce Pelly who did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday left by the Associated Press

British officials said Tuesday they would double the number of inspections carried out at oil rigs in the North Sea following the disastrous leak at a BPoperated installation in the Gulf of Mexico
Britains Department of Energy said the average number of annual environmental checks aboard the countrys numodd drilling rigs would rise from eight to num and said it was hiring three extra inspectors to help pursue the more aggressive program
The department did not provide details of the inspections but said they involved visits to each rig
Energy Secretary Chris Huhne said that while he believed the measures governing the nations offshore energy industry were robust the catastrophic leak and its aftermath had given the government pause for thought
Tens of millions of gallons of oil have already poured into the Gulf of Mexico after a deadly blast at the Deepwater Horizon rig on April num turned its well into an oil geyser staining beaches and costing hundreds of millions of dollars
Londonbased energy company BP PLC has repeatedly failed to plug the well over the past month and a half although a cap recently installed above the gusher has started siphoning off at least some of the spill
BP also operates a large network of platforms pipelines and terminals up and down the North Sea where oil and gas exploration began in the nums
With new energy exploration beginning in deep waters off the Scottish archipelago of Shetland Huhne said there was every reason to increase our vigilance
Huhne also promised the creation of a new oil industry group to report on Britains ability to prevent and respond to a potential spill

Farmworkers are the only hourly employees in the state who are not paid overtime after eight hours of labor in a standard numhour workweek a special discriminatory status that has endured for decades
Now California has an opportunity to right this wrong
State Sen Dean Florez DShafter has successfully shepherded a bill through the Legislature that would give those who do the backbreaking work of picking fruits vegetables and nuts equal status with other workers
Opposition to the legislation predictably comes primarily from the farm lobby which maintains that the current rule granting overtime only after num hours in one day or num hours in a week is all the industry can afford
But agribusiness argues in circles
Some growers say their profits would wither if the proposed overtime rules were made mandatory
Others say workers not farmers would suffer because growers would dodge new overtime rules by hiring more employees to work eighthour shifts
Still others argue that its consumers who would pay in the form of higher food prices
Variations of those arguments were put forth by other industries when the eighthour workday and numhour workweek were debated decades ago
But officials opted to pay workers fairly
some lawmakers favor overtime for an eighthour workday others prefer a numhour week before overtime is required
but the parameters are not negotiable
Furthermore if growers eventually elect to hire more workers instead of paying overtime thats not necessarily a bad thing job creation is a boon to the state
We acknowledge that growers may indeed incur additional expenses and yes consumers may see a rise in prices
But the new law also would benefit the economy by putting more spending money into the pockets of farmworkers and perhaps by creating new jobs
And lets not forget the subsidy already enjoyed by consumers and growers The farming workforce is largely made up of illegal immigrants who often will work for lower pay than US workers with few if any benefits
Normalizing their working conditions should be the concern not only of those who favor fair treatment but also of those who understand that employment double standards encourage illegal immigration
The states growers do have special labor needs but the solution is for Congress to pass legislation that would provide them with a steady legal stream of labor
not for California to uphold discrimination
Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign SB num
San Diego UnionTribune Ban open carrySaldanas measure a reasonable restriction on firearms
Lets see if we have this right
Gun lovers are concerned that Californias gun laws are too restrictive
So they decided that the best way to make their case would be to stage a series of demonstrations in which they gather in public places with firearms brazenly displayed on their hips disturbing everyone from law enforcement officers to families in Pacific Beach and Escondido to patrons of Starbucks Peets Coffee Tea and California Pizza Kitchen up and down the state
Do you wonder how thats working out for them
Not so well it seems
After some of her constituents were frightened by an open carry demonstration in Pacific Beach last year San Diego Democratic Assemblywoman Lori Saldana introduced legislation that would ban the open carry of firearms
It should be noted that the open carry proponents display only unloaded weapons at their demonstrations in order to comply with Californias apparently unique law that permits the open carry of weapons but only if they are unloaded
Some states prohibit open carry altogether
Those that do permit it a significant majority allow the weapons to be loaded
Saldanas measure AB num would close the loophole allowing the open carry of unloaded weapons making it a misdemeanor to do so
The bill has passed out of the Assembly and the Senate Public Safety Committee
It is scheduled to head to the Senate Appropriations Committee on July num and if approved as expected it will then face a tough fight on the Senate floor
It is just not acceptable to have people in modernday California wandering around while openly packing pistols as if it were the Wild West
And its not just families and coffeeshop patrons who are troubled by the displays
The California Police Chiefs Association is among the supporters of the bill
Open carry is not just a threat to public safety its a threat to officers Emeryville Police Chief Ken James told UnionTribune reporter Michael Gardner
Adding to the absurdity of the open carry campaign is the fact that its not really about open carry
What proponents really want is the freedom to carry concealed weapons
If the San Diego County Sheriffs Department would issue more concealed carry permits we would have no reason to continue our activities wrote Gerald T Reaster founder of EscondidoOpenCarryorg in a recent piece in the UTs Dialog section
Some gunrights advocates have suggested that last weeks num Supreme Court decision that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to state and local gun control laws would make Saldanas measure unconstitutional
The majority opinion authored by Justice Samuel A Alito Jr noted that the court while striking down a law that prohibited the possession of handguns in the home recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose
Reasonable gun laws like Saldanas are permitted
The state Senate must pass it and Gov
Arnold Schwarzenegger must sign it
Santa Maria Times Taking break in Sacramento
Our lawmakers in Sacramento have scattered to the four corners of the state and places in between as part of the Legislatures annual summer recess
As usual theyve left the capital without having agreed on a state budget which is seriously overdue
Party leaders are supposedly hashing out budget details and they saw no need to keep everyone on the job at least not until there is a compromise which there is not
Also as usual lawmakers are trying to paint a happy face on the situation saying that sending lawmakers back to their home districts will save taxpayers some money
When our policymakers are in Sacramento theoretically conducting the states business they are entitled to a perdiem stipend of $num
in addition to their alreadyinflated salaries
to cope with such lawmaking demands as getting to the nearest happy hour on time
It may make financial sense but its still annoying that lawmakers are taking a vacation while the budget remains in limbo
It seems like the party leadership ought to keep lawmakers around as a form of punishment
A political science professor at Claremont McKenna College has suggested lawmakers should stay in Sacramento and voluntarily waive the perdiem cash as an act of good faith
But in almost the same breath he said the chances of that happening are roughly equal to William Shatner winning an Oscar for best actor
Scotty just beam the whole bunch up
MediaNews California lawmakers must pass teacher reform
Because of a prolonged weak economy and declining tax revenues California schools have been forced to cut their budgets often by laying off large numbers of teachers
However the pain of the cutbacks has not been borne equally
Lowperforming schools in poorer neighborhoods have suffered disproportionately in many districts throughout the state
In the states largest school district in Los Angeles for example three schools faced losses of as much as num percent of their faculty while many schools were scheduled to lose num percent or less
The reason for the huge disparity is state law that forces districts to lay off their least senior teachers first
Often lowperforming schools have a higher percentage of new teachers who are the first in line to be laid off
As a result those schools endure the most disruption which makes it more difficult for them to improve student performance
Fortunately a recent court decision blocked the Los Angeles Unified School District from laying off wildly disproportionate numbers of teachers at three middle schools
To correct the disproportional layoffs Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg has sponsored legislation that would generally prohibit teachingstaff changes at lowperforming schools those scoring in the lowest num percent on state tests that are disproportionate to those in a school district as a whole
The bill would require parity in school layoffs even when teachers with more seniority at other schools would lose their jobs as a result
Also superintendents would be required to balance experience levels when deciding where to place teachers
Steinbergs SBnum is a laudable response to civil rights lawsuits that rightly contend poor youngsters are being damaged by discriminatory allocation of teachers and other resources
Unfortunately the bill is being opposed by the teachers unions
They argue that the legislation would rely on stateadministered tests that categorize school performance scores
The unions say that would be using test scores for teacher evaluation a policy they strongly oppose
The unions also remain adamantly opposed to exceptions to seniority rules
To its credit a majority of those on the Assembly Education Committee understand that SB num is a reasonable solution to the inequality among schools regarding teacher experience and approved the bill by a num vote
We are disappointed but not surprised that Assemblyman Tom Torlakson DAntioch was one of the two no votes on the measure
He is running for state superintendent of public instruction and is backed by the California Teachers Association
Evidently pleasing his union supporters takes precedence over helping students who attend lowperforming schools in poorer neighborhoods
Steinbergs reform measure deserves passage by the Legislature and Gov
It is especially important now with the large number of faculty layoffs and reassignments that unfairly affect schools most in need of experienced teachers
Sacramento Bee All special districts need special scrutiny
Its understandable why residents want local control of fire protection parks and water
Hundreds of special districts sprouted across California to provide such services
But theres a disturbing downside to the proliferation of all these fiefdoms particularly independent special districts that have their own elected boards and run their own affairs
As the num Sacramento County grand jurys final report laid out in excruciating detail because so many operate outside the same kind of public scrutiny trained on city councils and county boards of supervisors theres an appalling lack of financial transparency accountability and oversight
There are num independent special districts in California num of them in Sacramento County
In its report June num the grand jury surveyed num including the Carmichael Water District Cordova Recreation and Park District and the Cosumnes Community Services District
The inquiry revealed that Districts are spending millions without competitive bids
Over five years num of them awarded a total of more than $num million in nobid contracts
The districts most of them CalPERS members have significantly increased pensions and twothirds have allowed spiking by basing payments on a workers highest num months of salary
Twothirds of districts are not doing management audits and less than num percent filed mandatory financial audits
Onethird of board directors are appointed and only half were chosen in contested elections raising questions of cronyism
The grand jury noted that accusations of impropriety by directors are common and that some districts have let entertainment and other board expenses get out of control
Perhaps most worrisome the only agency with any real power over the districts is by its own admission falling down on the job
In cases of district dysfunction the grand jury said the Sacramento Local Agency Formation Commission has the power and responsibility to initiate corrective changes
It has not done so
LAFCO has completed only a few of the required wideranging municipal service reviews of the districts
Peter Brundage LAFCOs executive director says the agency is putting together a new reporting system to make sure the reviews happen more often
That was prompted largely by the grand jurys withering report in April on the Rio LindaElverta Water District which it found was unable to guarantee safe drinking water and enough water to fight fires and was beset with dysfunctional leadership
But in its response last month LAFCO said that while it agreed with the grand jurys findings it did not have the power to force Rio Linda to build another well secure standby power or make other safety changes
That is distressing indeed and points out the need for more oversight or even a more basic review of what all these special districts have become
San Jose Mercury News California can stop outrageous insurance rate hikes
Reasonable increases in health insurance premiums are inevitable
Medical costs are out of control and while federal health care reform may eventually slow their growth it wont happen quickly
Most estimates put the expected increase in medical costs at around num percent this year which is bad enough
So when Anthem Blue Cross announced a num percent increase in its California rates in February the howls of protest reached the halls of Congress where the outrage helped the cause of national health care reform
And in Sacramento lawmakers began talking about regulating health insurance rates the same way we do car insurance
Assemblyman Dave Jones a Sacramento Democrat running for state insurance commissioner is trying to put a check on the doubledigit premium increases of recent years with a bill that would require health insurers to justify their rates similar to current rules for auto insurers
Some num other states already do this
AB num passed the Assembly in June and will be heard by the Senate Appropriations Committee in early August
It should whip through the Senate and be signed by the governor
After Anthem Blue Cross humongous increase got everyones attention the company admitted that it had used a flawed formula and miscalculated the amount it needed
But its revised calculation announced last week still calls for a num percent rate increase
Aetna Health Care had announced a num percent increase earlier this year but it too was forced to admit that it had made mistakes in its calculations and withdrew its proposed rate increase
Doesnt it make you wonder how much past miscalculations have cost Californians and inflated insurance company profits over the years
If nothing else Jones legislation would force insurers to be more transparent about how they go about calculating their rates
California has been down this path before
In num voters approved Proposition num which forced auto insurance companies to justify their rate increases
That proposition not only resulted in significantly lower rates but it also brought more insurance companies into this market
Insurance companies spent millions opposing Proposition num and theyre fighting Jones tooth and nail on AB num
The Assembly vote was on party lines with Republicans opposing the bill
Arnold Schwarzenegger has yet to take a position on it
Jones bill has the support of US Sen Dianne Feinstein
Earlier this year she introduced legislation at the federal level that would enable the US secretary of health and human services to review insurance companies rate increase proposals and reject any that are not justified
Her legislation would only affect states that do not have the power to protect consumers
On the chance that Feinsteins bill does not pass California should take care of itself
The health care reforms enacted by Congress are only the first big step toward curing this countrys ailing system
It will take at least a decade to finetune the legislation and find ways to drive down medical costs
For Californians Jones bill is crucial to help protect them from unreasonable rate increases in the interim
Drivers using the Indiana Toll Road started shelling out more cash for fares Thursday as rates went up for the first time in two years

Drivers using electronic toll devices have been protected from price increases
That price protection will expire in num when everyone will pay full price
Rarely has tax policy so dominated an election as in the race to succeed US Rep John Linder a Georgia Republican who became an icon among fiscal conservatives for coauthoring a bestselling book on replacing the national income tax with a sales tax
The eight Republicans trying to succeed Linder dont argue over whether the country should adopt a consumption tax
called the fair tax by Linder
Instead they disagree over who knows it best and believes in it most
I dont think youre going to survive in that district if youre not a proponent of and a true supporter of the fair tax said Neal Boortz a libertarian talk show host and Linders coauthor of The FairTax Book Saying Goodbye to the Income Tax and the IRS
Take for example Pat and Dennis Gutendorf who live outside Lawrenceville and decided to support Linders former chief of staff Rob Woodall in the Republican primary Tuesday
Part of their decision was based on Woodalls work on behalf of the fair tax
Everyones going to pay some taxes Dennis Gutendorf said of the plan adding it applies to rich and poor alike
These million and billionaires wouldnt have all these loopholes to hide behind and save all their money
With a fair tax people would be taxed not on what they earn but rather on what they spend
Proponents say the system would effectively end the need for the Internal Revenue Service and the nations complicated tax code although economists and other critics question whether it would raise enough money to fund government
Every Republican in the race
Woodall state Rep Clay Cox Jody Hice Chuck Efstration Jef Fincher Ronnie Grist Tom Kirby and Tom Parrott
support the fair tax because they say it will boost the economy or simplify the tax code
Democrat Doug Heckman who is running unopposed in his partys primary after losing to Linder in num has a more jaded view
He wants to keep the income tax while simplifying the system
Everybody on the Republican side has jumped on it
And its because they want the support of Linders followers theres a lot of money associated with it Heckman said
When you get out of his district the interest in it falls markedly
Pride seems to count a lot in this debate
Woodall says other Republicans in the race have not mastered the nuances of the tax as well as he has
Woodall said unless hes elected sponsorship of the fair tax bill will pass to a Republican lawmaker elsewhere
The people who believe in the cause would not allow it to be introduced by a junior congressman who would not have the faculties to push it forward
Im the exception to that rule Woodall said
Because folks if you know the fair tax you know me
Other candidates embrace the fair tax with equal enthusiasm including the fundraising leader in the race Cox
He campaigned doortodoor recently in a wellheeled subdivision of Grayson wearing a Tshirt that advertised his support for a state resolution calling on Congress to pass the fair tax

It could be its going to have to be tested on the state level he said

West Virginia lawmakers were asked Monday to consider hiking the states main tax on coal as well as fees and fines paid on the trucks that haul that natural resource
The recommendations were among a halfdozen from the authors of a recent report that concluded that the coal industry is costing the state budget more than it provides
The West Virginia Center for Budget and Policy and the firm Downstream Strategies presented their findings to a HouseSenate legislative interim subcommittee
Their June report estimated that while revenues from the industry topped $num million during the num budget year it cost the state $num million more
The costs included $num million spent repairing roads damaged by heavy coal trucks and $num million worth of tax credits and exemptions
While calling on the Legislature to revisit the tax breaks Rory McIlmoil of Downstream Strategies recommended fees on trucks of at least $num per ton hauled
The report estimates that fees now average around num cents per ton
McIlmoil also said increasing fines could help deter overweight trucks
Hiking the severance tax on mined coal from num percent to num percent meanwhile would raise another $num million annually
The report recommends sending num percent of that new revenue to coalproducing counties
The report drew some of its revenuerelated data from a February study of the states coal economy by researchers at Marshall and West Virginia universities
The lead Marshall contributor to that study warned lawmakers Monday of flaws in the subsequent report
Cal Kent Marshalls vice president of Business Economic Research said the June report omits property tax revenues and discounts the overall impact of severance tax proceeds
Kent also took issue with the way it counted tax exemptions as costs to the state budget
All told Kent estimated that the industry provides $num million more in revenues than costs
Kent and Marshall researcher Elizabeth Eastham also provided figures showing that West Virginia levies the heaviest tax burden on the industry when compared to a dozen other coal producing states including all five of its neighbors
West Virginia the nations secondlargest producer taxes coal as real estate at differing rates depending on whether its actively mined held in reserve or considered unmineable
Wyoming the nations coal leader does not impose any property taxes on coal land
But McIlmoil and the budget and policy centers Ted Boettner noted that their report also estimates $num billion in such legacy costs as playedout surface mines that await cleanup and damage to state roads and bridges not yet repaired
It also cites a projected decline in coal production within the next decade and echoes calls for West Virginia to diversify its economy
Kent told lawmakers that the question of coals costs merited further study while Boettner said his groups report aimed to start a dialogue on the subject
Delegate Nancy Guthrie said the subcommittee should request a new study that draws from both reports as well as a third recently issued on the topic and determine once and for all what the true impact and costs and benefits are from coal
Each one of these provides only a snapshot said Guthrie DKanawha
US Attorney Joe Hogsett says hell ask the appropriate federal agency to review an ethics dispute that has embroiled the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and Duke Energy Corp
The Citizens Action Coalition and Common CauseIndiana last week asked Hogsett to investigate the matter in which commission general counsel Scott Storms continued presiding over some matters involving Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy while seeking a job with Duke
Hogsett sent the private watchdog groups a letter Friday saying no decision has been made on whether to proceed with an investigation and the Department of Justice generally doesnt confirm or deny investigations
FBI spokesman Special Agent Drew Northern says he also cant confirm or deny any investigation
Inventories held by US wholesalers rose for a fifth consecutive month in May but sales fell for the first time in more than a year sending a cautionary signal about the strength of the recovery
Wholesale inventories increased num percent while sales dropped num percent the Commerce Department said Friday
It was the first decline for sales since March of num
The May sales decline is the latest sign that the economic recovery could be losing momentum in the second half of the year
Weakness in sales could discourage businesses from boosting their orders
That would translate into a slowdown in factory production
Businesses helped spur the recovery by rebuilding their inventories after slashing them during the recession
The gross domestic product expanded at a num percent rate in the final three months of last year largely because of the swing in inventories
The trend in inventory rebuilding continued in the first quarter of this year but at a more modest pace
That was among the reasons growth slowed to num percent
Mike England an economist with Action Economics said Fridays wholesale inventories report has persuaded him to lower his growth estimate for the AprilJune quarter to num percent from num percent
England noted that the report lowered Aprils inventory growth to a num percent increase
half the initial estimate of num percent
But Peter Newland an economist at Barclays Capital said the drop in sales wasnt a major concern because the inventory to sales ratio remained near a record low
He said that should spur businesses to continue to rebuild stock levels in coming months
Many economists believe overall economic growth will slow to around num percent in the second half of this year
Thats partly because they expect less of a boost from inventory rebuilding in coming months
That could be bad news for manufacturers one of the strongest sectors since the recession ended
It also would come as the recovery is starting to weaken
Both consumer spending and business hiring have slowed and the housing market has struggled since government incentives for homebuyers ended in April
The jobless rate fell to num percent in June from num percent in May
But the change was largely the result of people giving up their work searches
Economists worry that weaker growth wont bring down the jobless rate quickly
We are on a muddlethrough trajectory for this recovery with GDP growth at about half the rate you would normally see coming out of such a steep downturn England said
Even with the May gain in wholesale inventories they are num percent below where they were a year ago
Inventories at the wholesale level had fallen for num consecutive months through September of last year
Businesses went through a massive liquidation of their stocks in a struggle to contain costs during the deepest recession in decades
The num percent drop in sales in May followed a gain of num percent in April
The combination of declining sales and rising inventories pushed the ratio of inventories to sales up slightly to num in May from a record low of num in April
That means it would take num months to deplete stocks at the May sales pace
Over the past decade a typical level for the inventory to sales ratio has been between num months to num months

If youre too old for trickortreating but still love getting spooked on Halloween its time to trade in the superhero costume for a ticket to a haunted house or theme park
But attractions like Universals Halloween Horror Nights and Atlantas Netherworld Haunted House are not for the faint of heart
Youll be trapped in creepy mazes disoriented by strobe lights and fog and confronted by crazed monsters
Experiences like these are not recommended for kids under num but even some grownups may not be able to handle them
If watching a Stephen King movie keeps you up all night or youre prone to panic attacks in small spaces better stick to applepicking or the childfriendly Mickeys Not So Scary Halloween Party at Walt Disney World
On the other hand if you love the tingle of terror that comes with a really creepy horror movie this is your kind of fun

Universal Orlando in Florida began its Halloween attraction as a tiny little experimental event with one haunted house over one weekend in num according to Jim Timon senior vice president of entertainment
This year hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the country are expected for the parks numth annual Halloween Horror Nights with eight haunted houses six scare zones and num scareactors in the park
The content is newly created each year for the Horror Nights with original story lines and characters
This years characters include an evil master named Fear who drives all the other monsters diabolical deeds
Details about the back stories in the park attractions can be found on Universals website fans can then see them come to life in the park
Timon said the costumes stories and sets are so rich realistic and detailed that they are filmquality
We could literally make our own new movies from these characters
The lighting the special effects the visuals
we do everything we can to suspend your disbelief and take away your illusion of control
One of Universals haunted houses this year is called Legendary Truth an estate home with a history of murders that have resulted in paranormal activity
Timon said the house has an unusual setup in which visitors trigger the special effects themselves
People are used to us scaring them he said
When they are the ones triggering the effects by how they are interacting with the haunted house thats even scarier
Its a cool trick when they eventually realize Im the one causing this
A note to Harry Potter fans Universal Orlando consists of two parks
Halloween Horror Nights takes place at Universal Studios Florida not at its sister park Islands of Adventure where The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is located
Universal Studios Hollywood theme park in Los Angeles has its own Halloween Horror Nights which are mostly themed on horror films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the numth
For a new maze this year unrelated to the movies Universal created an original graphic novella Vampyre Castle of the Undead which can be seen online
The park also created a new scare zone haunted by La Llorona based on a Latin American legend of a crying woman who drowned her children in anger over her philandering husband
Details and tickets for Universal parks on either coasts can be found at httpwwwHalloweenHorrorNightscom

Netherworld Haunted House in Atlanta
num on a list of top scariest attractions compiled by Larry Kirchner editor of Hauntworld Magazine an online industry publication
Netherworld promises that visitors will find themselves fleeing flying gargoyles escaping from a house where the floors crack open and furniture comes to life and trying to avoid capture by a mad scientist known as the Mangler whose victims meet their fate in a drowning tank flesh compactor and acid room
When you go through a haunted house on the level of Netherworld youre totally immersed in an environment as detailed as a movie Kirchner said
But he added that theres a major difference between watching a movie and visiting a haunted house
When you see a horror movie youre sitting in a theater seat num feet away from a screen and nothing is going to shake your seat or fall in your face
In a haunted house youre living in the horror movie Kirchner said
He added that part of what makes haunted houses so compelling is that they are also unscripted live shows that change every night depending on how the actors interact with guests so no two visits will be exactly alike
The complete list of Kirchners num favorite Halloween attractions is at httpwwwhauntworldcom
Another list of Halloween bests comes from Haunted Attraction Magazine which lists MustSee Haunted Houses at httpwwwhauntedattractioncom starting with House of Shock in New Orleans
Others in the Haunted Attraction top num are Kevin McCurdys Haunted Mansion in Poughkeepsie NY Scarehouse in Pittsburgh Dead Acres in Columbus Ohio House of Torment Austin Texas Fear Itself Mishawaka Ind
Dent School House Cincinnati Nightmare on numth Salt Lake City Wisconsin Feargrounds Waukesha Wis and Blood Manor New York City
But how do the creators make these experiences so scary
Timon from Universal said one of the fundamentals at the Orlando park is disorientation
Strobe lights and ultraviolet lights dilate your eyes mazelike corridors and darkness make it hard for you to figure out where youre going mirrors make you think someone is next to you when theyre actually some distance away
People are terrified of losing control Timon said
So we love taking away that control
Another technique is distracting guests with an elaborate scene like a gory body on a gurney
Youre focused on it because its really elaborate so youre not paying attention to the four people who are sneaking up on you Timon said
Just remember at all of these attractions actors are trained to invade your space without ever touching or harming you so youre always safe even when youre scared out of your wits
Its terror as a form of entertainment said Timon
People like the scare but they know theyre in a safe environment

Unemployment in some rural Oregon counties is getting worse rather than better despite signs of recovery elsewhere in the nation
The worst jobless rate statewide in September was in Crook County at num percent
just under the Depression peak of num percent nationally in num
The central Oregon county was among six counties suffering from unemployment rates over num percent last month
and among five in the high desert east of the Cascade Range The Oregonian reported
Other rural areas of the state were not faring well either
In southern Oregon Jackson Countys unemployment rate jumped to num percent for September exceeding the Medford areas seasonally adjusted levels throughout the current recession
Were right back to where we were a year ago said Carolyn Eagan an Oregon Employment Department regional economist in Bend where many residents feel they cant move away to find work
The jobless rate jumped from num percent in August to num percent in September in Deschutes County and the Bend area
We have people in Deschutes County who are just stuck because they own a house and they cant sell it for what they owe on it Eagan said
The numbers released Monday show a state buoyed mostly by Willamette Valley and Columbia River Gorge counties with the bulk of the population
Employment in those areas has kept the statewide jobless rate at num percent still among the worst in the nation and a full percentage point above the US unemployment rate of num percent in September
Both central and southern Oregon also have been affected by the downturn in the neighboring California economy which dipped to num percent in September
In the past both those regions of Oregon experienced growth when California retirees surged north to spend on houses second homes and vacations
Counties in those regions also have been hit by the woodproducts industry downturn said David Cooke an Oregon Employment Department economist
Nikki Jones owner of Express Employment Professionals in Medford and Grants Pass said the Great Recession has been by far the worst in terms of both unemployment and the overall economy during her num years in the temporary help agency business

Jones said she continues placing lowwage temps with companies that dont follow through with permanent hiring
Employers are utilizing temp staffing much longer than in the past she said
Transit workers said they had no warning of an impending accident at the moment a fellow driver allegedly distracted by text messaging smashed his trolley into theirs in the tunnel outside a station
Jimmy Zhu said his trolley was stopped outside the Government Center station at about num pm when the other trolley barreled into his shutting down the trolleys lights and sending passengers into a panic
Dozens of people were injured
All of a sudden there was an impact
the lighting on my train went out and people were yelling and screaming Zhu said in an interview with investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
His interview was among dozens of documents related to the crash that the agency released Wednesday
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has blamed the crash on the drivers inattentiveness
The NTSB has yet to reach its own conclusion about the probable cause and its final report isnt expected for months
Zhu was the operator in charge of the rear part of the train that was hit
I went back into the passenger compartment I guess to assess the injuries
There were several injuries head lacerations or lacerations in general and orthopedic injuries Zhu said
People were in a panic state
I tried to keep my composure to see however I could help
The accident occurred as a numyearold Green Line operator Aiden Quinn was typing a text message on his cell phone according to an MBTA review of phone records transportation documents and witness testimony
As Quinn was texting MBTA officials said he ran through yellow and red warning lights and into the twocar train ahead of him between the Government Center and Park Street stations
He was fired and indicted on a felony charge of grossly negligent operation
An interview with Quinn was not included in the documents released Wednesday though Zhus testimony and other field reports released by the NTSB provide some eyewitness accounts and additional details
The second operator in the train driven by Quinn said he was knocked out of his seat
Charles Hanna stationed halfway back in the train said it felt like there were two impacts like the train hit something and then kept going
He said he radioed in that there had been accident and then saw Quinn
He says he hit the train in front Hanna told investigators
I asked him What did we hit and he says We hit a train
We hit the train in front
He then said Quinn disappeared
The operator of Zhus trolley Cindy Gillespie was in the front of the trolley car which stopped at a red light
She said two trains were stopped ahead of hers waiting to get into the next station
Like Zhu she said she had no warning before the crash
He hit me pretty hard
It threw my eyeglasses off she said
I didnt know what happened
Gillespie who said her back and neck ached after the crash said the lights were still on in the front part of the trolley
She said she got up to check on the passengers
There was a lady behind me with two small children that was saying Oh my back my back Gillespie said
So I went over to them to make sure they were all right
I said I dont know what happened but somebody will be here
Zhu who wasnt hurt said it took about five minutes for rescue officials to arrive and begin treating the injured
After the accident the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority enacted a strict policy requiring any operator caught using a cell phone on the job to be suspended for num days with a recommendation that they be fired
An operator caught carrying a cell phone while working is suspended for num days
If caught carrying one again the penalty is the same as if they had been using it
At least num drivers have been disciplined since the new regulations went into effect

The flower girl at Jessica Zabalas wedding is purple sixfeettall uninvited and smells like dead bodies
She is Lois a rare corpse flower deemed the worlds stinkiest bud
Lois is unexpectedly blooming in the Houston Museum of Natural Science in the room right next to where Zabala is marrying Jonathan Smith on Saturday
I dont need a florist anymore Zabala laughs
The flower is an Amorphophallus titanum which has only ever bloomed num times in the United States
Its happened twice in Texas but never before at the museums Cockrell Butterfly Center which hosts about num weddings a year
I did not know that Lois was quietly sprouting in the greenhouse across the street Zabala said donning an I Love Lois button given to her by the museum
Deforestation has left the flower endangered in its native tropical rainforests of Sumatra Indonesia said Nancy Greig the butterfly centers director
Six years ago the center paid $num for a little walnutsized tuber from a Raleigh NC nursery that specializes in exotic plants
The flowers deadbody smell attracts the flies and beetles it needs to pollinate
It can only blossom after it is seven years old and weighs num pounds exactly the size of Houstons plant
Lois was about twothirds of the way to full bloom by Thursday and between num and num people were visiting daily
She will only stay open about two days and the smell generally dissipates within num hours Greig said
Museum experts initially thought she would bloom two weeks ago and Greig was certain the stench would overtake the museum by Thursday
But she has not turned on the funk yet Greig said
So Zabala and Smith remain uncertain

State lawmakers will convene a weekend special session to substantially cut the states $num billion budget deficit Gov
The bipartisan agreement will reduce the states revenue shortfall through June by about $num million Gregoire and legislative leaders said
The special session will start Saturday morning with a goal of wrapping up work in one day
If all goes well and the creek dont rise well go home Saturday night
Who knows what hour but Saturday night Gregoire said
About $num million of the total savings will come from capturing some of Gregoires previously ordered acrosstheboard spending cuts
Roughly $num million more will come from federal money intended to boost education jobs
The balance of savings measures includes reductions to social services prisons and education
The agreement also counts on about $num million in transfers from dedicated accounts outside the state general fund
Specific savings include roughly $num million from eliminating a classsize payment for Knum public schools while another $num million comes from additional furloughs for the Department of Social and Health Services
Two major social service programs financed entirely by the state
the Basic Health Plan and Disability Lifeline

Tax increases of any kind wont be part of the solution because voters last month approved Initiative num mandating a nearly impossible twothirds majority vote for the Legislature to raise taxes
These are difficult decisions but we have to live within the revenue box that we have said Senate Minority Leader Mike Hewitt RWalla Walla
Legislative leaders were forced to cobble together the emergency savings plan after last months state revenue forecast showed an unexpected drop in nearterm tax collections
That pushed an already strapped state budget back into the red and prompted Gregoire to call for a special session
The Legislature led in both the House and Senate by Gregoires fellow Democrats is not scheduled to return for its normal numday session until Jan num
Lawmakers also have to fix an estimated $num billion deficit in the roughly $num billion state budget for num
Gregoire praised the efforts of lawmakers who met in drawnout negotiating sessions this week to build the budget agreement
While it doesnt solve the entire nearterm deficit it makes significant progress toward that goal she said
They have worked hard under very difficult and strange circumstances to advance the ball so when they come back in January they can finish Gregoire said
Canadas economy lost num jobs in September for the second time in three months even though the unemployment rate edged down onetenth of a point to num percent
Statistics Canada said Friday the unemployment rate fell because fewer workers particularly young people were actively looking for employment
While the job losses last month were small it appears to confirm the economy which had once been churning out jobs at a rate of over num a month during the first half of the year has ground to a halt
Statistics Canada said averaging the last three months employment barely crawled forward by about num jobs a month on average half of what analysts believe is needed just to keep up with population growth
There is no denying the fact that employment conditions have cooled markedly from the piping hot pace seen as recently as the spring said Douglas Porter deputy chief economist with BMO Capital Markets
Renewed solid job gains will be tough to come by in the months ahead amid the lackluster pace of underlying growth that has spilled over from the US into Canada
Statistics Canada said the key softness came in the parttime category where num jobs were shed
Fulltime employment saw a healthy pickup of num
As well hours worked rose slightly and payroll employment rose offsetting a decline in selfemployment
With gains in actual hours worked and fulltime positions registered in the month the September report was somewhat better than that implied by the decline in the headline job count said TD Banks Derek Burleton
Economists had been predicting a tepid jobs month keeping with an economy that registered the first monthly contraction this summer in almost a year
But they were looking for a modest num increase and the unemployment rate to stay put at num percent
An investigator for the Indiana Gaming Commission has been asking questions about a claim by Majestic Star Casino that it lost money because of the closure of a key Lake County bridge
The inquiry follows comments Jan num by Majestic Star Vice President Jason Gregorec about the closures effects during a public hearing The PostTribune of Merrillville reported Saturday
Gregorec told lawmakers the companys two Gary gambling boats laid off num employees as a direct result of business lost from the closure of Indiana State Road num and its bridge over the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal
Gregorec also said Indiana had lost $num million in tax revenue and the closure meant an num percent revenue loss for Majestic Stars casinos
But Larry Buck Majestic Stars general manager said Friday that the closure alone cant be blamed for the revenue loss
He said the Gaming Commission probably is trying to clarify the statement
There are so many variables that affect our revenues Buck said
Its probably unfair to attribute any one month to any one variable
Concerns over the milelong bridges integrity led state officials in November to close a nummile stretch of the highway known locally as Cline Avenue which is a major artery to and from Chicago
It carries about num vehicles a day and serves the ArcelorMittal steel mill and the Ameristar and Majestic Star casinos on Lake Michigan
Detroit businessman Don Barden owner of Majestic Star made a similar revenue argument to the Indiana Senates appropriations committee Thursday while testifying on a bill to allow landbased gambling
The Cline Avenue bridge is out and its closed indefinitely Barden told the panel
Our revenue has dropped num percent since that has happened roughly
Barden said Friday that he didnt mean to imply that loss was entirely because of Clines closure
Democratic Senate candidate Joe Sestak urged voters during a rally at Penn State University to fight for change as he courted college students who may be key in his tightening race against Republican Pat Toomey
Speaking before about num people Saturday on the steps of the Old Main adminstration building Sestak said he was the better choice to help create jobs and tried to paint Toomey as outoftouch with middleclass Pennsylvanians in part because of his Wall Street background
Also Saturday Sestaks campaign boasted of an endorsement from The Philadelphia Inquirer which was to be published in Sundays editions
Im in it for one reason I want to pay back the desire to believe again to trust Sestak told the crowd
About twothirds of the crowd was made up of college students or young adults
a voting bloc that boosted President Barack Obama in the num election
With the race close Toomey and Sestak are angling for undecided voters like Michael Kasomenakis a numyearold senior who wanted to get a better read on Sestaks positions particularly on immigration policy
He said he also was unfamiliar with Toomeys positions
The psychology major said hes an independent who felt let down by Obama after voting for the Democrat two years ago
I dont know too much about Sestaks policies
Ive been asking a lot of people around here and it wasnt very definitive he said before Sestaks speech
Penn States University Park campus is the largest in the state with an enrollment of nearly num
With a little more than a week left before the Nov num general election Sestak could get a boost if he can attract young voters who backed Obama
You dont vote for change once
You fight for change Sestak later told reporters touching on a catchphrase from the presidents num campaign
Toomey had no public events Saturday but was scheduled to appear at Penn States student union Wednesday with Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Corbett
Kristin Anderson a Toomey campaign spokeswoman said the businessman and former congressman from the Allentown area has aggressively courted young voters across Pennsylvania college campuses
Like many Pennsylvanians young voters are concerned about the jobkilling policies Joe Sestak has supported in Washington Anderson wrote in an email
The race has tightened in recent weeks with a Muhlenberg CollegeAllentown Morning Call poll of likely voters released Saturday showing num percent supporting or leaning toward Toomey with num percent favoring Sestak and another num percent undecided
The poll also showed Sestak leading among voters age num to num num percent to num percent
The Inquirer in its endorsement praised Sestak for ideas promoting clean energy and providing small businesses with incentives to create jobs
In the Senate Sestaks views would be much more in line with most Pennsylvanians the newspaper said
And as he did during Friday nights debate between the two candidates Sestak continually brought up China
part of the Democrats strategy of assailing Toomey as pushing tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and large corporations that outsource jobs
In Congress hes fighting for education and helping imprve the economy so we can find jobs after we graduate Penn State senior Greg Reed num said in introducing Sestak
Junior David Carr num president of a student group backing Toomey was among about a dozen supporters in attendance holding signs for Toomey
Carr said he backed the Republican for his track record in small business and his fiscal conservative leanings while in Congress
I dont think a majority of young people will go our way Carr said but I believe there will be much greater GOP support than num

I approached her because Ive know Barbara for years

Michigans childwelfare system is failing to meet the conditions of a sweeping num agreement intended to improve foster care and protective services a courtappointed watchdog said Tuesday
Kevin Ryans latest report traced the problems to management at the Department of Human Services under Gov
He said Michigans new governor will have an opportunity after Jan num to build a highlevel leadership team and fulfill an agreement to more quickly move kids out of foster care and into permanent homes
Unless there is a fundamental adjustment in their approach to this undertaking it is unlikely this reform will reach most of the children and families
in the foreseeable future Ryan wrote
A New Yorkbased group called Childrens Rights whose lawsuit led to the consent decree had planned to ask a judge to appoint a receiver to take over Michigans childwelfare system but it backed off Tuesday and said Govelect Rick Snyder deserves a chance to tackle the problem
Well consult with the new team attorney Sara Bartosz said
In num the state settled a lawsuit filed on behalf of nearly num children
Michigan agreed to many changes including hundreds of new hires to reduce the caseloads of workers who oversee children in foster care or protective services
Ryan said the state failed to achieve by a wide margin caseload numbers for workers who investigate allegations of child abuse and neglect
And with more than num people soon retiring he said the department does not expect to comply in the months ahead
DHS has not only been slow to respond to the need for more investigators but leadership has also let this group of staff fall farther and farther behind Ryan said
In other areas it is taking the state more than six months instead of the numday target to grant licenses to people who want to take care of children who are relatives Ryan said
His monitoring team also discovered a basic math problem at the department when trying to understand just how many kids were entering and leaving the childwelfare system
There is a formidable gap between what Michigan agreed to in num and what has happened since then Ryan said
US District Judge Nancy Edmunds was disappointed by the news
She wants to meet with all sides in late January or February after Snyder takes office
Im hopeful we can turn some of these things around Edmunds said
She said Snyder wanted to attend the hearing but was discouraged by his staff because hes not governor yet and had to be tied down to stay away
Human Services Director Ismael Ahmed refused to answer questions about the report as he left court directing them to his staff
He starts a new job in January at the University of MichiganDearborn
DHS continues to make every effort to ensure vulnerable children have safe stable and loving homes where they can thrive and reach their full potential spokesman Edward Woods III said
Its unconscionable that the plaintiff and the court monitor suggested that by a change of administration there would be more of a sense of urgency from the Michigan Department of Human Services
Both chambers have passed legislation that would add another six months of increased federal Medicaid payments to cover states through the num fiscal year which runs from July num this year through June num
But differences between the two versions have to be reconciled before a bill can be sent to President Barack Obama to be signed into law
State leaders lawmakers and health care advocacy groups say the extension is needed to avert further cuts to Medicaid the statefederal health insurance program for the poor in the wake of a stubborn recession
Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed last year $num billion was allocated to increase the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage the federal share of Medicaid
But the enhanced payments expire Dec num the midway point of the fiscal cycle for most states
The emergency assistance was intended to help states deal with swelling Medicaid caseloads as workers lost jobs and employersponsored health insurance during the economic downturn
While most economists agree the recession has ended economic recovery has been slow with unemployment still hovering near num percent nationally and around num percent in Minnesota
Unfortunately the length and depth of the recession means states and territories will continue to face significant budget shortfalls long after the enhanced FMAP provisions expire at the end of this calendar year said a recent letter from the National Governors Association urging House and Senate leaders to act
Tim Pawlenty was among eight governors all Republican who did not sign the letter
Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said that although the governor supported the effort he objected to some of the language
The governor did work with NGA staff to rework portions of the letter but we recognize that can be difficult when dealing with num state governors and five territorial governors McClung said
Minnesota is among num states looking at gaps in their num budgets according to a recent report by FamiliesUSA a consumer health care advocacy group
The group says many of those states will have to make cuts to Medicaid unless Congress extends the increased payments
Ron Pollack director of FamiliesUSA a health care advocacy group said he was encouraged that Congress and the White House seem on track to grant an extension soon
This should allow states an opportunity to plan without the cutbacks that would have occurred Pollack said
Obama has included $num billion in his num budget proposal to provide an additional six months of increased payments
The House included an extension in the jobs bill it passed late last year
The Senate followed up last week with a measure backing Obamas $num billion infusion
Minnesota would receive $num million under the presidents budget proposal according to FamiliesUSA
The groups analysis included an economic impact of a sixmonth extension of the Medicaid stimulus funding
It would sustain num jobs $num million in wages and $num billion in business activity in Minnesota the study determined
Many states have already begun shaping their num budgets in anticipation of receiving the increased Medicaid assistance through the full fiscal year the report said
Sen Al Franken DMinn emphasized the potential impact of state budget cuts to the nations economy in a Feb num letter signed by num senators calling for the enhanced FMAP extension
The budget closing actions that states have indicated they will take in the absence of additional fiscal relief could cost the economy up to num jobs and derail the fragile economy the letter said
The potential Medicaid budget crunch comes as states are facing recordbreaking enrollments according to a study released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundations Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured
Nearly num million more people were in state Medicaid programs in June num than in the previous June the analysis found
In Minnesota num people were in the program in June num compared to num in June num
The num percent jump was the numthhighest percentage increase in the country
State Medicaid programs have been able to help millions of Americans who have nowhere else to turn in a recession said Diane Rowland executive vice president of Kaiser Foundation
But the states obviously face significant fiscal pressures as increases in enrollment push up costs at a time when state budgets are already severely constrained
In a May num letter obtained by Gannetts Albany Bureau Cuomos staff alerted Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Army Secretary John McHugh of the pending lawsuit against SmartBuy based in Fayetteville NC and several of its affiliates nationwide
The lawsuit will seek restitution for what Cuomos office estimates may be tens of thousands of military members who were allegedly duped by SmartBuy and its stores near military bases in at least a halfdozen states including New York Texas California and Georgia
In March Cuomo sent a letter to SmartBuy about his intent to sue the company because of a store it set up near Fort Drum in northern New York
Thousands of victims may have been impacted at Fort Drum his investigation found at a cost of more than $num million in recent years
Cuomos letter alleges that the company targets active members of the service by enrolling them in costly loan agreements on computers and other electronics
Cuomo said the company has stores near other military bases including near Fort Bragg in North Carolina Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Carson in Colorado
Moreover the company buys its equipment at retail stores and then drastically raises the price as much as two to three times the original price states the letter which is signed by David Sampson New Yorks deputy attorney general
When notified of the impending suit SmartBuy shut down its operations at a strip mall in Watertown NY a few weeks later
In num the state of Tennessee was awarded $num million against an affiliate company Rome Finance Company Inc
The company has been seeking bankruptcy protection in California
An attorney for the company denied any wrongdoing
Our client has been in business for many years and has provided a valuable service to members of the military and their families said Gabriel Nugent a Syracuse attorney in a statement
SmartBuy is proud of its business and its reputation
SmartBuy strongly disputes the claims made by the New York state Attorney General and looks forward to presenting its side of the story
In a letter to employees last month the company said it is closing its business in New York and may resume operations in Tennessee
Surprisingly we do not even know the actual claims the attorney general has against us the letter from Woody Webb SmartBuys general counsel states
We also do not know of any customer complaints in New York nor has the Attorney Generals Office informed us of any aggrieved or complaining individual
Cuomos letter alleges that SmartBuy and its affiliates has targeted members of the military and has unlawfully attempted to sell them computer and other electronic equipment that is marked up num percent through a financing system that ends up causing the military personnel to pay over num percent in interest on the purchase
The letter alleges that the company also engaged in a variety of fraudulent business and lending practices

Theres another union timebomb ticking away on Gov
one more bill that needs an expeditious veto
The bill would remove an important arrow from city officials disciplinary quiver
and for that reason alone it should be killed
Under current law police officers or firefighters remaining on the job after num years have an increased incentive to keep their noses clean Criminal or other serious misconduct could cost them their lucrative pensions if theyre dismissed for serious cause
As the Sunday Post reported six numplus year NYPD veterans in the last few years were fired and stripped of their benefits
including a cop who was convicted of committing perjury in the line of duty
The bill on the governors desk would change all that
A stillemployed numyearsplus veterans pension benefits would be locked in
even in the face of say a jobrelated felony conviction
Theres absolutely no reason for this change in law except to appease the citys alwayspowerful police and firefighter unions
Obviously a member of the NYPD or FDNY
has a presumption of innocence in a criminal trial
And in a disciplinary procedure members of these services have fierce advocates standing beside them
But serious misconduct is serious misconduct When it happens it should carry a significant price
Indeed the presence of such a sanction stands to reduce serious misconduct
Patersons duty is clear Veto this bill
The PostStar of Glens Falls on regional coopetition
Just when we were getting used to saying webinar and racino without having to swish a capful of mouthwash along comes the newest buzzword from the folks who asked us who moved their cheese
Put them together and you get coopetition
Its a hard word to say
If you dont put the hyphen in there it looks like youre talking about chicken coops
Spell check doesnt even recognize it as a word
But of all the new concoctions fashioned these days to satisfy our need to synthesize our thoughts and save keystrokes on Twitter this strange word epitomizes a change in both the way business conducts itself and in the way economic development is going to be successful in our region
The other day the heads of the Economic Development Corporations from Warren and Saratoga counties sat next to each other in our conference room talking about their recent scoping trip to Silicon Valley to make connections for bringing businesses back to New York to feed off GlobalFoundries
It was an odd sight in a way seeing Dennis Brobston from the SEDC and Len Fosbrook from the WEDC politely taking turns answering questions about economic development passing out each others brochures and describing how wonderful it is that this region is blessed with so many assets regardless of whose borders they happen to fall within
Cue the soundtrack from Sound of Music
It always seemed in the past that the two organizations and the two counties were in competition with one another
for business for developments for grant money whatever
And apparently they still are
But they appear to have finally realized that a business considering moving here from Texas doesnt care about our petty municipal border skirmishes
it just wants a nice place near the action to set up shop so it can make a profit
Rather than adopting an ourcountyornowhere policy the two economic development agencies are increasingly finding its better to hang together than to hang separately
In addition by approaching companies together rather than individually the two economic agencies are discovering the benefits of pooling resources and sharing expenses particularly at a time when money to spend on economic development is harder than ever to come by
The move toward coopetition comes not necessarily out of niceness but out of necessity
Frankly outside of GlobalFoundries largely a state success neither county has exactly been a magnet for new business lately
The poor economy corporate downsizing and a growing awareness of foreign competition have forced companies and economic development groups to reconsider the benefits of going alone
Barry Nalebuff of the Yale School of Management more than a decade ago coauthored a book outlining the warandpeace nature of business in which businesses both compete with and complement other businesses
The success of most businesses he wrote is dependent on the success of others
Yet they still must compete to capture value created in the market and to protect their own interests
He cited the example of airlines competing for gates and landing slots while at the same time sharing research and development data to produce safer more fuelefficient planes
An article in January on ZDNet a tech trade website called coopetition the new norm describing how its been employed with great success by large tech companies such as IBM HewlettPackard Microsoft Cisco and Google
Likewise the coopetition strategy might be the best approach our region has in attracting businesses and capitalizing on the GlobalFoundries wave
Both Brobston and Fosbrook admitted that while both counties have decent infrastructure most notably the Northway and proximity to water and sewer lines they individually come up fairly short on an inventory of modern moveinready building sites
Given the many options that companies have for transplanting the two EDC presidents now find they have no choice but to start sharing the resources and business leads theyd previously have kept to themselves
Coopetition might be a funny word but when it comes to our regions future economic success its no laughing matter
Competition is still the main driver of innovation and the principal opponent of complacency
But if businesses economic development groups and governments want to give themselves the best chance to succeed in this economic climate theyre going to have to throw out their natural competitive instincts and start working more closely together
The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle on Obama and the state of the war in Afghanistan
While the leak of secret Afghan war documents offered a momentary shock to many it should motivate President Obama to give a thorough update on the conflict
That hasnt happened since his speech of Dec num when he announced he would send an additional num troops
Its true as the administration has argued that the approximately num secret documents reflect mostly known problems and actions for six years prior to the surge in troops
But many citizens dont follow the day inday out of the war and feel uneasy
The more liberal Democrats in Congress debating a war funding bill have seized on the security breach to question US involvement and strategy once again
Given that some politicians and citizens question the war funding as the deficit soars Obama should update the public on the objectives he outlined in December
First he should explain what progress if any Pakistan has made to prevent collusion between that countrys military intelligence and the Taliban
The Afghan papers reinforce previous reports that Pakistan hasnt done all it should to oust the Taliban
As Obama has pointed out US success is linked to its partnership with Pakistan
Next Obama should clarify what help the United States is getting from other allies several of which promised in late num to step up troop commitments
Obama also can outline other progress made with reaching out to tribal leaders to combat corruption a key part of the strategy he announced in December
Finally Obama must clarify whether July num remains the target to begin troop withdrawal
The administration has backpedaled on that saying the timing and size of withdrawal have yet to be decided
The leaked war documents remind how complicated the war effort is its time for a thorough progress report
The Times HeraldRecord of Middletown on disabling cell phones in vehicles
Like most addictions the one that entices drivers to use cell phones behind the wheel is never going to succumb to the wisdom of education or the weight of law enforcement
Only technology will curb this behavior and any delay will increase the toll in fenders crunched and lives lost
In every steering wheel put a chip that incapacitates a phone within a few feet
Make the chip a requirement to pass inspection or register a car
If a driver wanted to make a call he could pull over and get out
Its good to take a break and stretch every so often anyway
It really is that simple and it really is that necessary
If we have learned anything from the auto safety disputes of the past its that all the talk about how reluctant people are to change their behavior only delays the inevitable while the toll mounts
Remember when seat belts were an option a big brother intrusion that nobody liked and nobody wanted and nobody would use
Now the only surprise in the news that num percent of people use seat belts is that there are num percent stupid enough not to
As a story in the Times HeraldRecord on Sunday reported cell phones and distracted driving are the cause of at least num percent of all crashes
At the same time national polls show that more and more people believe that it should be illegal to talk on a cell phone and drive
The National Highway Safety has an explanation for this gap
People know distracted driving is dangerous but believe they can handle the two functions while others cannot
I can drink because I can handle my liquor but he cant
I dont need a seat belt because I know how to drive and avoid trouble but he doesnt
The experience with seat belts does not offer a comparison to cellphone use because while both require a change in behavior they come from different directions with different force
Using seat belts required people to do something and do it once not stop doing something that provides a constant temptation to keep doing it
And even though seat belts work to save lives and minimize injury this simple technology was not enough to do the job
Thus we have cars with steering columns designed to collapse seating areas surrounded by metal and engineered to absorb the force of any collision while the seat belt serves mainly to keep the driver and passenger from rattling around or falling out
And we have air bags
They pop out in front and on the sides and above turning the passenger compartment into a survival pod more wired and monitored and redundant than the capsules we used to send people into space
Nobody is suggesting that all of this is unnecessary that we could eliminate the cost of air bags if we tried a little harder to educate drivers and had more enforcement
Nobody says that because nobody believes it makes sense
Now the question is How long it will take before we have the same consensus on cell phones and driving
The Daily Gazette of Schenectady on doubts about federal testing of edible fish from the Gulf of Mexico
Government officials have declared that most of the fish swimming in the Gulf of Mexico where the largest oil spill in history occurred three months ago is now safe to eat
They offer no scientific data from tests being run on the fish but there appears to be little available anyway because the testing methodology isnt very scientific
Rather than determining how much oil brokendown oil or chemical dispersants are in the fish government inspectors have been relying on a sniff test
Is it any wonder that some of the fishermen themselves are dubious about the governments claims
True the leak from Deepwater Horizon which poured num barrels of oil a day into the gulf has finally been capped and the huge oil slick it created has been breaking down more rapidly than expected
But the government has been using routine testing methodologies for a spill of unprecedented proportions
one that involved not only record amounts of oil but record amounts of chemical dispersants
As they decompose the substances may affect each other the fish the food chain and humans in unprecedented ways
ways that are not immediately apparent
Its important that government work continue so a more scientific test can be developed to pinpoint the actual levels of contamination that the data and testing methodologies be released as they become available and that longterm testing on the impact of these substances on the environment be implemented
Toward this end Louisiana Gov
Bobby Jindal has been pressing BP to make good on its pledge to pay for such a program
The federal government should join him

South Carolina gained enough new residents over the past decade to add a seventh congressional seat in num according to Census Bureau data released Tuesday that will give Republicans state lawmakers a chance to shore up GOP gains made this fall
The state grew by num percent to num million residents in the past num years according to the data
In all the US population hit num million reflecting the lowest growth since the Great Depression and an increase of num percent over the num US resident population of num million said Census Bureau Director Robert Groves
Neighboring Georgia also is picking up a congressional seat while Florida is adding two
North Carolina also grew but not enough for an additional seat
Texas was the biggest winner with four
The majority party in each states legislature redraws the election map though federal oversight and generally a legal challenge follow
State House and state Senate lines also see changes each decade
In South Carolina Republicans control both legislative chambers and the governors office which could make the effort less contentious than in the past
In num a Republican governor vetoed the plan drawn by a Democratcontrolled Legislature and a Democratic governor nixed a GOP plan in num
Joel Sawyer executive director of the state GOP said the additional seat means South Carolina will have a greater voice in Congress and in this red state that likely means more Republican influence
I feel very confident about our ability to pick up an additional Republican congressman when this process is all said and done he said
Beginning in February the Census Bureau will release population and race breakdowns down to the neighborhood level for states to redraw congressional boundaries
Republicans already have an eye on population estimates that show South Carolinas growth has been heaviest in four counties York just south of Charlotte NC and Horry Beaufort and Charleston along the coast according to Wesley Donehue political director for the state Senate GOP caucus
That indicates a new district could be carved from the coast as the current numth District seat becomes more Republican
Last month freshman state GOP Sen Mick Mulvaney ousted the states longestserving congressman Democratic Rep John Spratt from that seat
The Legislature has to pass a redistricting plan and allow time for a US Justice Department review and a likely lawsuit which anyone could file before the February num presidential primary said Bobby Bowers research director for the state Budget and Control Board and chairman of the South Carolina Complete Count Committee
Justice Department approval is needed because of the num Voting Rights Act which would not allow a move that could hamper the influence of the states minority voters Bowers said
South Carolina is about num percent AfricanAmerican
The November election left US Rep Jim Clyburn who is black as the states lone Democrat in Congress representing a numth District that is the lone one with majority AfricanAmerican voters
Tim Scott a black Republican is heading to Congress to represent the numst District which is majority white
State Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said it would be possible to draw a second socalled majorityminority district but a swing district also could be created
They could draw it so its possible for a Democrat to win not predetermined to be one party or the other she said
It is not necessary to draw six Republican seats
I think the voters would prefer to choose their own congressman not to have him elected in the Republican primary
South Carolina lost a seventh congressional seat after the num census
Electoral College votes are based on the number of US Senate and US House seats in each state

A state senator for num years Nunnelee has raised the most campaign cash for Tuesdays threeway Republican primary in north Mississippis numst Congressional District
The winner advances to the November ballot to challenge Travis Childers a numyearold conservative Blue Dog Democrat who has held the seat since midnum
and an incumbent that the National Republican Congressional Committee has targeted as potentially vulnerable
Childers has voted with President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on stimulus spending but opposed the health care overhaul
two issues the Republicans criticize frequently
There have been no public polls in the GOP primary but Nunnelee num is viewed as the frontrunner because of his numplus years in the state Senate
He faces Angela McGlowan num of Oxford a political strategist and former Fox News analyst whos been courting tea party voters and Henry Ross num a former mayor of the small town of Eupora who also served as a state circuit judge
Nunnelee runs an insurance business in Tupelo and has been chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee the past three years helping write state budgets as tax revenues plummeted
He entered the Republican primary with the most name recognition and hopes to avoid a runoff in whats expected to be a lowturnout primary after Memorial Day weekend
Marty Wiseman a political scientist and director of the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University says the Republicans in the primary and the thirdparty candidates who will be on the ballot in November are trying to tie Childers to Pelosi and Obama
Wiseman says that might be effective with some voters in the socially conservative district but might fall flat among traditional Democrats or people who dont see Childers as partisan
The rhetoric Ive heard out of the three Republicans
It just makes you drop your jaw Wiseman says
Nunnelee has criticized federal stimulus spending although he used hundred of millions to help balance the state budget this year and last
He also criticizes the federal health overhaul
I just think if you have to cut deals in the middle of the night and not tell anybody what youre doing its the wrong thing Nunnelee says in Corinth

Arizonas primary election isnt until Aug num but Republican incumbent Jan Brewer and her Democratic challenger Attorney General Terry Goddard are now both clearly looking past it
Goddard already was unopposed for the Democratic nomination for the governors office hes sought twice before but Brewer still faced a contested primary on the Republican side
That changed with businessman Buz Mills exit Tuesday from the Republican race
He suspended his bigspending campaign leaving Brewer facing only political newcomer Matthew Jette in the primary
Jette a selfdescribed moderate has little money and drew support from fewer than num percent of those surveyed in a recent poll before the primary
That same survey by Phoenixbased Behavior Research Center found Brewer with an overwhelming lead among registered Republicans and independents planning to vote in the Republican primary
Brewer now can look past the primary and she plainly is
She immediately issued a statement that called for unity among Republicans and without naming Goddard said voters have a choice between the advocates of bigger government uncontrolled spending and unaccountable education policies and those of us committed to smaller government job creation fiscal discipline and quality education
Goddard meanwhile fired away at the unelected incumbent
a reference to Brewers elevation to the governors office when her predecessor resigned
He accused Brewer of failed leadership as he cited the states economic and budget troubles
The two candidates targeting of each other make perfect sense given the altered political landscape said Fred Solop a Northern Arizona University political science professor
With Mills move this essentially begins the general election process in Arizona Solop said
We now have a presumptive winner of the Republican nomination
We have a presumptive winner of the Democratic nomination
Goddards campaign has been relatively quiet but this really forces him to change his strategy Solop said
He can no longer sit out the primary and wait for the general election
The general election begins now
Meanwhile Brewer needs to broaden her campaign past the immigration issue that worked so well to help her fend off GOP critics Solop said
Now she needs to go even more toward the center to look for the independent voters to look to what degree she can pull from Democratic voters
Both candidates have showed signs of a growing focus on economic issues with Brewer using her office to announce a revamp of the states businessrecruitment efforts
Goddard is said to be close to releasing his own plan
One touchy but likely unavoidable subject for both candidates will be the states continued budget troubles
Goddard hasnt offered a budget plan of his own but he has criticized Brewer for costcutting measures that cut services as she and the Republicanled Legislature tackled big budget shortfalls
Brewer defends her record as facing up to challenges foisted on the state but acknowledges more painful belttightening is on the horizon
At least on paper the $num billion state budget for the justbegun fiscal year is balanced
But the state may not get an anticipated $num million of federal stimulus money
Also an equal amount of dollars to help pay for already approved spending is contingent on voters approving two ballot measures to divert money set aside for early childhood programs and land conservation
Those two ballot questions alone will help draw attention to candidates stances on budget issues said Kristin Borns a senior policy analyst at Arizona State Universitys Morrison Institute
But that discussion could be difficult for the candidates both because of its complexities and the reality that even approval of the two referendum questions wouldnt be a cureall to the states budget troubles Borns said
We are not on steady ground
We are still going to face a budget deficit next year
The major candidates for Illinois governor Democratic Gov
Pat Quinn and Republican state Sen Bill Brady released new sharply contrasting television campaign ads Thursday
Quinn focuses on his opponent tying him to the gun violence that produces tragic headlines almost daily in Chicago
Brady focuses on himself presenting a sunny but vague picture of what he would do as governor
A closer look at the ads
In stark terms the ad tries to do two things tie Brady to gun violence and plant the idea that he is a potentially risky unknown
The ad opens with images of a gun
This is a deadly semiautomatic assault weapon
Its not used to hunt ducks or deer
Its used to hunt people
and kill them the narrator says as the chalk outline of a body appears
The ad correctly points out that Brady opposes reinstating a ban on assault weapons
It goes on to say Brady opposes restrictions on guns near schools
The ad cites two pieces of legislation one in num allowing an immediate oneyear suspension for students who bring a gun to school and another in num stiffening penalties for bring an illegal gun within num feet of a school
Records show Brady voted against both measures
The ad closes with the narrator asking Who is this guy
The more we learn about Sen Bill Brady the worse it gets
Quinn may hope that Brady a veteran Bloomington legislator is a blank to many voters
If he can fill that blank spot with negatives
in this case guns and violence
Quinn stands a better chance of keeping independents and disgruntled Democrats from swinging to the Republican candidate
The Quinn campaign says the ad will run only in the Chicago area
It could hurt him if downstate voters see it
Assault weapons are less of a concern outside the Chicago area and downstate voters tend to resent weapons restrictions
Brady accused Quinn of distorting his record
Aides say he may have voted against these particular bills but he also supported others that restricted guns around schools
Im not for guns in schools and he knows that Brady said adding that the gun shown in the ad is already illegal in Illinois
Bradys ad is a positive recap of his views without any policy specifics
He promises to stop the insane borrowing balance the budget without raising taxes stand up to special interests and create jobs
These are difficult times but we can have a brighter tomorrow Brady says
The ad presents a kaleidoscope of pretty images the State Fair Brady on a farm sunlight through the trees Brady overlooking Chicago
It manages to squeeze num images into just num seconds
In effect Brady is answering the question of who is this guy
with pictures and promises that are as upbeat as Quinns ad is downbeat
But the ad doesnt answer the many questions that Bradys promises raise
For instance despite his promise to balance the budget Brady has acknowledged he lacks a specific plan for closing the states recordhigh $num billion deficit
He promises to cut spending num percent but says he wont provide details until after taking office
Brady is spending about $num to run his ad statewide while Quinns Chicagoonly spot will cost about $num said people familiar with the ads speaking on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss costs publicly

Terry McAuliffe an unsuccessful candidate for governor in num is in the running again
this time to buy a soontoclose Southside paper factory he wants to convert to a woodfired power plant
McAuliffe and other investors are pitching to International Paper Co to purchase the firms giant Franklin mill in Isle of Wight County which is to be closed this year throwing num people of work
McAuliffe and one of his partners Peter OKeefe a longtime political associate declined to discuss details of their offer to Memphisbased International Paper citing confidentiality requirements
McAuliffe said the proposal is not tied to a possible repeat bid for governor in num that he is only doing as a private investor what he emphasized during his run for the Democratic nomination last June focusing on creating socalled green jobs
I would be doing this governor or no governor McAuliffe said Monday
the eve of a visit to the plant Tuesday by Gov
Bob McDonnell a Republican and his top economic advisers
International Paper closing the Franklin mill because of the recession and overcapacity in the papermaking industry is considering offers for the Virginia plant and others
Proposals are due Feb num
We are indeed very interested in acquiring the Franklin facility OKeefe said
We think that weve got a very competitive offer
The closing is a huge blow to Franklin erasing a source of jobs for three generations of workers
The shutdown is part of a larger pattern
the steady loss of manufacturing jobs across the rural southern tier of the state for more than a decade as companies battle cheaper foreign competitors or shift jobs overseas
It was not immediately clear how many jobs the McAuliffeled offer might generate
However there was speculation it could ultimately produce about num jobs
not just at the plant but in related areas such as harvesting trees as fuel
Further such a plant could link up with the power grid perhaps selling electricity to Virginias vast informationtechnology industry
I am interested in moving the state forward in green power to preserve and create jobs said McAuliffe who also is the head of an electriccar company that is considering building a factory in Virginia

Three unexploded bombs dating back to World War II were discovered at Warsaws international airport during construction work Tuesday prompting the evacuation of an airport hotel officials said
Flights however were not interrupted because the bombs were not seen as posing a danger to travelers within the terminal
One bomb was found num yards from the main terminal during work for a planned train station that will link the airport to Polands capital airport spokesman Przemyslaw Przybylski said
Explosives experts sent to deal with the bomb then discovered two others
The airports Courtyard by Marriott hotel was evacuated said Aneta Winnicka another airport spokeswoman said
It wasnt immediately clear if the bombs would be removed or disarmed on the spot Winnicka said
Such findings are relatively common in Poland Germany and other countries that saw intense fighting during the war
Russia secured a longterm foothold in the energyrich and unstable Caucasus region Friday by signing a deal with Armenia that allows a Russian military base to operate until num in exchange for a promise of new weaponry and fresh security guarantees
The numyear extension will allow the bases fighter jets and thousands of troops to operate outside former Soviet territory lifting a previous restriction
The agreement could raise tensions between Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan who have clashed over NagornoKarabakh a rebellious ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijans territory
Azerbaijan shares ethnic and cultural bonds and close ties with Turkey
The protocol doesnt just allow the Russian military base to stay in Armenia for a longer period it also extends the sphere of its geographic and strategic responsibility Armenian President Serge Sarkisian said after talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
The deal is part of Moscows efforts to strengthen its clout in exSoviet nations which have worried many of its neighbors
Russia fought a brief August num war with Georgia which borders Armenia to the north and tensions have remained high
Russia wants to underline its role as the key player in the region Sergei Minasian a Yerevanbased political expert told The Associated Press
Russias clout on former Soviet turf which Russian leaders have declared a privileged zone of interests has remained limited however
Moscow has run into fierce economic and political disputes with its onetime closest ally Belarus
Russian and Belarusian leaders have traded barbs and blamed one another for an increasing strain in relations
Russia also has talked much about raising its influence in Central Asia and has grown increasingly jealous of the US presence there but it did nothing when the government of Kyrgyzstan asked Moscow to send troops to help put down deadly ethnic violence in June
After their talks the Russian and Armenian presidents were joined by other leaders from a Moscowled security alliance of seven exSoviet nations
Medvedev said the Kyrgyzstan unrest showed that the Collective Security Treaty Organization needed to be able to respond more quickly and effectively in crisis situations
He said the treater organization leaders agreed to form a plan by the end of the year and he recommended studying the experience of other organizations such as NATO the EU and United Nations
Armenia on Friday also awarded Russia with a contract to build two new reactors at a Sovietera nuclear power plant
Construction works on the $num billion project are expected to start next year
Russia has maintained close ties with Armenia since the Soviet collapse providing economic assistance to the landlocked nation whose economy has been crippled by blockades by Azerbaijan and Turkey over the conflict in NagornoKarabakh
Russian already provides a security guarantee to Armenia under the CSTO and it was not clear how the new guarantee would be different
Russias base in Armenia has about num troops along with MiGnum fighter jets and Snum air defense missiles according to Russian and Armenian reports citing official sources
Medvedev said the base is intended to support peace and stability in the southern Caucasus and the entire Caucasus region
NagornoKarabakh has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces since a sixyear conflict ended with a num truce
Azerbaijan has often voiced concern about Russian military cooperation with Armenia
Russia is taking part in mediation efforts on the NagornoKarabakh conflict along with the United States and France under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe but attempts to reach a settlement have failed and sporadic clashes have continued in a tense zone around the region
We have neither peace nor war Sarkisian said Friday
Its bad that there is no peace but at least there is no war
Turkey and Armenia signed an agreement last October to restore diplomatic ties and reopen their shared border but neither has ratified it

Uncertainty over a Marine base and plans to move thousands of US troops to Guam are straining a postWorld War II security alliance Japan and the United States set num years ago but Tokyos new leader said Tuesday he stands behind the pact
Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he sees the arrangement as a crucial means of maintaining the balance of power in Asia where the economic and military rise of China is looming large and vowed to stand behind it despite recent disputes with Washington
Keeping our alliance with the United States contributes to peace in the region Kan said in a televised questionandanswer session with other party leaders
Stability helps the USJapan relationship and that between China and Japan and in turn China and the United States
The USJapan alliance formalized over violent protests in num provides for the defense of Japan while assuring the US has regional bases that serve as a significant deterrent to hostilities over the Korean Peninsula or Taiwan
Under the pact promulgated num years ago Wednesday nearly num American troops are deployed throughout Japan
The US forces include a key naval base south of Tokyo where the only permanently forwarddeployed aircraft carrier has its home port Kadena Air Base which is one of the largest in Asia and more than num US Marines on the southern island of Okinawa
The large US presence over the past five decades has allowed Japan to keep its own defense spending low to about num percent of its GDP and focus its spending elsewhere
a factor that helped it rebuild after World War II to become the worlds secondlargest economy
Even though there are some small problems here and there in the bigger sense the relationship remains strong said Jun Iio a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo
Very few people think that it is actually necessary to make major changes in the alliance
But while the alliance is one of the strongest Washington has anywhere in the world it has come under intense pressure lately over a plan to make sweeping reforms that would pull back roughly num Marines from Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam
The move was conceived in response to opposition on Okinawa to the large US military presence there
more than half of the US troops in Japan are on Okinawa which was one of the bloodiest battlefields of World War II
Though welcomed by many at first the relocation plan has led to renewed Okinawan protests over the US insistence it cannot be carried out unless a new base is built on Okinawa to replace one that has been set for closing for more than a decade
A widening rift between Washington and Tokyo over the future of the Futenma Marine Corps Air Station was a major factor in the resignation of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama earlier this month
It could well plague Kan as well
Kan has vowed to build a replacement facility on Okinawa as the US demanded but details are undecided
Implementing the agreement would need the support of the local governor who has expressed opposition to it
Kan was scheduled to visit Okinawa on Wednesday for ceremonies marking the end of the num battle there that hastened Japans surrender
Recent tension on the Korean peninsula and Chinas growing military assertiveness have undoubtedly driven home the importance of the US security pact with Japanese leaders
Before he stepped down Hatoyama suggested that the March sinking of a South Korean warship allegedly by a North Korean torpedo contributed to his decision keep Futenma on Okinawa
reversing a campaign pledge to move it off the island
Tokyo was alarmed in April when a Chinese helicopter came within num feet num meters of a Japanese military monitoring vessel in the vicinity of a Chinese naval exercise
That same month Chinese ships were also spotted in international waters off Okinawa
Still the Okinawa problem underscores an increasingly skeptical stance among some Japanese leaders toward the role of the security alliance
Though the pact was strongly supported by the staunchly proUS conservative party that ruled Japan for most of the past num years the newly empowered Democratic Party of Japan which swept to office last year have taken a more nuanced approach saying that while close security ties with Washington remain crucial Japan needs to improve its relations with its Asian neighbors particularly China
On Monday Kan said he will reassure Obama when they meet at a summit this weekend that JapanUS ties continue to be the cornerstone of Japans diplomacy
But he added that I want to view this relationship from a broader point of view and stressed Japan must not forget the importance of developing its Asian relationships

North Dakotas pension funds for teachers and government workers rose num percent in value in their last budget year but the rebound does not offset recent losses an investment administrator told state legislators on Wednesday
Pension funds across the country are in trouble but I would say North Dakotas not insurmountable said LeRoy Gilbertson the interim director of North Dakotas Retirement and Investment Office
Some of them its questionable whether theyre going to be able to come out of it
Gilbertson spoke to a legislative committee that is considering proposals for the num Legislature to raise contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System and the Teachers Fund for Retirement
The PERS fund covers North Dakota government workers and public employee pension plans in Fargo Grand Forks and Bismarck
The PERS fund had about $num billion and the teachers fund had about $num billion in assets on June num the end of the budget year Gilbertson said
Both increased in value by num percent during the last budget year after plummeting more than num percent the year before
Lawmakers are considering several proposals to bolster the pension funds including requiring increased contributions from workers and their taxpayerfinanced employers or making a lumpsum infusion of taxpayer money into the funds
Complicating the work is an audit of the Retirement and Investment Office that should be finished by the end of August
It was ordered after the April suicide of the offices former director Steve Cochrane
A permanent new office director should be hired by late fall
North Dakota was among num states whose pension funds were recently rated by the nonprofit Pew Center as needing improvement
North Dakotas pension funds do not offer automatic costofliving increases to beneficiaries although the Legislature has provided occasional benefit improvements
Gilbertson said the lack of automatic increases will make it less difficult for the funds to recover
Those are really expensive and some pension funds were extremely high a num or num percent a year increase he said
North Dakota doesnt have that

Cold War enemies the United States and Vietnam demonstrated their blossoming military relations Sunday as a US nuclear supercarrier cruised in waters off the Southeast Asian nations coast
sending a message that China is not the regions only big player
The visit comes num years after the Vietnam War as Washington and Hanoi are cozying up in a number of areas from negotiating a controversial deal to share civilian nuclear fuel and technology to agreeing that China needs to work with its neighbors to resolve territorial claims in the South China Sea
The USS George Washingtons stop is officially billed as a commemoration of last months numth anniversary of normalized diplomatic relations between the former foes
But the timing also reflects Washingtons heightened interest in maintaining security and stability in the AsiaPacific amid tensions following the sinking of a South Korean warship in March which killed num sailors
North Korea has been blamed for the attack but has vehemently denied any involvement
Last month during an Asian security meeting in Vietnams capital Hanoi US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also angered China by unexpectedly calling on the Communist powerhouse to resolve territorial claims with neighboring Southeast Asian countries over islands in the South China Sea
The strategic implications and importance of the waters of the South China Sea and the freedom of navigation is vital to both Vietnam and the United States Capt
Ross Myers commander of the George Washingtons air wing said aboard the ship Sunday as fighter jets thundered off the flight deck above
Im certain that the Chinese government and the Chinese people are trying to protect their interests he added when asked about Chinas increased aggressiveness within the area
It is more important for Vietnam and its partners to establish that they have an equal right to economic prosperity and peace within the region as well
Chinese navy ships were seen shadowing the USS George Washington at a distance over the past several days as the supercarrier made its way throught the South China Sea along Vietnams eastern coast US Navy officials said Sunday
China claims the entire sea and the disputed Spratly and Paracel islands over which it exercises complete sovereignty
But Vietnam Taiwan Malaysia Brunei and the Philippines also have staked claims on all or some of the territory which straddles vital shipping lanes important fishing grounds and is believed rich in oil and natural gas reserves
Clinton announced that the US has a national interest in seeing the claims resolved
The problem is that China has now committed herself publicly to sovereignty of the South China Sea and to push that back if only to the status of a claim that is not enforced is going to be very difficult said Arthur Waldron an international relations specialist at the University of Pennsylvania
So we are playing catch up reminding the Chinese that we have not collapsed into postgreat powerdom yet and that we have other friends in the region
Vietnam has long been vocal about the issue protesting Chinas plans to bring tourists to the islands and most recently seismic studies conducted near the Paracels
Last month China also held naval drills in the South China Sea
Vietnam does not support containing China but like most other ASEAN members would like to see each major power offset the other Carl Thayer a Vietnam expert at the Australian Defense Force Academy in Canberra said referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Quite simply these are not too subtle signals that Vietnam wants the United States to stay engaged in the region to balance China
The formidable USS George Washington is a permanent presence in the Pacific based in Japan
As one of the worlds biggest warships it is a floating city that can carry up to num aircraft more than num sailors and aviators and about num million pounds num million kilograms of bombs
It lurked Sunday about num miles num kilometers off the central coast of Danang Vietnams jumpingoff point for the disputed islands
A group of highranking Vietnamese military officials was flown onto the carrier Sunday along with other Vietnamese government officials and the US ambassador to the country
The supercarrier came to Vietnam following four days of highprofile military exercises last month with South Korea aimed at showing solidarity following the sinking of the numton Cheonan navy ship
The drills enraged Pyongyang and drew repeated criticism from its Chinese ally
A Chinese newspaper ran a frontpage story last week strongly hinting that China also is not happy about reports that Vietnam and the US are negotiating a civilian nuclear fuel and technology deal that could allow Vietnam to enrich uranium on its own soil
US State Department spokesman PJ
Crowley said China had not been consulted about the talks but he would not discuss the specifics of the enrichment provision
Congressional aides have said the agreement will likely not contain a noenrichment pledge which the US promotes as the gold standard for civilian nuclear cooperation accords to ensure materials are not being used to build a nuclear weapon
Vietnam has denied having any plans to enrich uranium on its own soil

Soon playing in a theater online trading of future boxoffice receipts for movies on a new exchange following approval by federal regulators
Unless that is Hollywood studios get their way and Senate legislation to ban the boxoffice futures becomes law
A divided Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday approved the proposed futures contracts for the new Trend Exchange
That means the movie futures trading can proceed it is expected to begin sometime in the third quarter
The first proposed contract for the exchange is for openingweekend receipts for Takers being released Aug num
Matt Dillon plays a cop who takes on a team of expert bank robbers
Major movie studios strongly oppose the idea
They say rival studios could sabotage films by betting against them
In giving its approval the CFTC said it found that boxoffice receipts fit the laws definition of a commodity that the Trend Exchange contracts arent readily susceptible to manipulation and they provide a way of managing risk
The agencys vote was num
Two CFTC commissioners Democrat Bart Chilton and Republican Jill Sommers voted against approving the contracts for the Trend Exchange
Popcorn prediction markets would serve no national public interest and dont meet the laws requirements on how commodities are defined Chilton said in a statement
Chilton said he also was troubled by whether the new futures trading would provide a legitimate way for the movie industry to hedge against risk since the agencys approval limits the use of the new contracts by movie studios
Allowing future boxoffice receipts to be traded like crude oil or pork bellies would give people who finance movies a way to make money even when a film doesnt
It also could be used for speculation
Trading would be based on the amount of money a movie takes in during its opening weekend
The exchange would set the initial odds for contracts but those odds would change based on bidding of investors
An investor who buys a contract with longer odds takes on greater risk and the potential to earn more money
For example an investor thinks a movie will make at least $num million in its first weekend
The exchange finds an investor who thinks the movie will fall short of that mark and the two investors enter the contract together
When the movie receipts come in the one who is correct gets a percentage on top of his investment based on the odds received
The other loses his investment
The CFTC previously approved the establishment of the Trend Exchange and the Cantor Futures Exchange
The proposed futures contracts establishing rules for trading have now gained the agencys approval for the Trend Exchange
For the Cantor exchange the deadline for approving the contracts is June num
Supporters led by investor groups that put up the money to make films say the concept would help generate new capital for the movie industry
A tougher economy has made it harder to finance films and trading futures on boxoffice receipts would help offset risk
We are pleased that the staff of the CFTC and a majority of the commissioners recognized the legitimate economic riskmanagement benefits that these products will provide to the entertainment industry Robert Swagger CEO of the Trend Exchange said in a statement
Opponents led by big Hollywood studios warn that complex trading brought down the housing market and this idea could do the same to the movie industry
In Congress the Senate version of the financial regulatory overhaul would ban futures trading on movie revenues
Its unclear if that ban will survive HouseSenate negotiations on the final legislation
The studios lobbying group the Motion Picture Association of America urged Congress Monday to put the ban in the final bill that will be signed by President Barack Obama
It is unfortunate that the CFTC has now given the goahead to a new gambling platform that could be plagued by financial irregularities and manipulation MPAA President and interim CEO Robert Pisano said in a statement
The new boxoffice contracts pose real possible economic damage to an industry that employs over num million men and women working in virtually every state in the country he said
Also opposed are the National Association of Theatre Owners the Directors Guild of America and the Independent Film and Television Alliance
Swagger said his exchange regrets that a specialinterest group of Hollywood industry insiders chose to politicize the issue and we will fight attempts by this group to overturn the CFTC outcome in Congress

San Juan County has received more than $num million in federal funding to offset losses from public lands that dont generate property tax revenues
County officials say the funding is a relief following a warning from Washington that socalled Payment in Lieu of Taxes funds would be smaller for some municipalities this year
Although many counties in New Mexico saw reductions to their PILT funding Sen Jeff Bingamans office said San Juan was among a few that received an increase
This has been a very difficult time for communities across New Mexico Bingaman spokeswoman Jude McCartin said
This little boost was some good news
The notice sent to counties warned that the US Department of the Interior which disburses the funding intended to change the formula of how county payments were calculated likely reducing payments in New Mexico McCartin said
The Interior Department encompasses Bureau of Land Management property and National Forest lands
San Juan County had included the $num million in federal PILT funding while balancing the budget for its num fiscal year that ended Wednesday but prepared lastminute adjustments for the possibility of less funding County Executive Officer Keith Johns said
When they tell us were going to get it we depend on it Johns said
We just have a lot of public land and when we dont generate any taxes from that and we only have num percent private land in the county PILT becomes a major thing for us
This year San Juan was one of four counties in New Mexico to receive more than $num million through the program which paid more than $num million statewide
The money paid to San Juan County through the PILT program has slightly increased in each of the past three years although the total amount paid to New Mexico has varied widely
Johns said receiving the full funding was a relief that helped balance the num budget just one day before the fiscal year ended
The funds are essential to the budget considering the loss of oil and gas royalty revenues and gross receipt tax payments
You bank on stuff like that
Thats a big chunk of money not to get Johns said of the PILT funding
Im really glad it worked out

A change in Ohio rules will limit the number of times a prescription may be transferred between pharmacies to once a year beginning Saturday
The Ohio State Board of Pharmacy approved the restriction last month because of pharmacists concerns about paperwork and possible communication glitches that can endanger patients said Tim Benedict the boards assistant director
If you keep transferring prescriptions around youre eventually going to have problems Benedict told The Columbus Dispatch
Also several retailers offer deals such as gift cards and percentageoff coupons for prescription transfers
Pharmacists have complained that they spend too much time dealing with transfers that are often initiated solely because of bargain offers Benedict said
Theres a difference between pennypinching and couponshopping to the point it becomes unsafe said Bill Winsley the executive director of the pharmacy board
Prescription transfers within the same retail chain such as from a CVS store in Ohio to one in Florida are exempt from the oneperyear limit because the stores share the same system of computer records the Dispatch reported
The rule change could cause hardships for Ohio snowbirds older residents who go elsewhere for the winter critics charge
They could transfer a prescription from Ohio to their winter home state
But unless the switch is made within one pharmacy chain they would not be able to make the transfer back to Ohio when they return with warmer weather
Tom Stone a Columbus resident and critic of the change wrote the pharmacy panel that those prescriptions are then marooned in the other state
Patients can avoid that problem through planning and by having a doctor write two separate prescriptions Benedict said

United and Continental airlines have reached the precipice of a merger agreement that their executives hope to announce on Monday a source involved in the negotiations said Friday
The announcement hinges on the boards of both airlines approving the deal said the source who is not authorized to speak for the airlines and requested anonymity
The board of Uniteds parent UAL is to meet today
Continentals board is supposed to meet today and Sunday
A union between Chicagobased United the thirdlargest US carrier and No
num Continental based in Houston would create the biggest airline in the world
Based on passenger miles flown in num the combination would be about num percent larger than the current world leader Delta Air Lines
Plans are that the merged airline would be based in Chicago and that Continentals name would disappear eventually
Continental didnt return a call
And the source said the deal still could fall apart before Monday
United and Continental reached a similar point in merger negotiations almost two years ago
But at the last minute Continentals board elected to remain independent
The source says that Continental CEO Jeff Smisek would become CEO of the combined airline
United CEO Glenn Tilton would be the nonexecutive CEO for two years
I think its a good move says Bob Harrell an airline industry consultant
A merger would need approval from regulators and some routes now flown by both carriers such as between Chicago and the New YorkNewark area may draw attention
But Continental and United generally have little overlap in the markets they serve he says
Continentals hubs are in Houston Newark and Cleveland
It has a large presence in Latin America where it is a strong No
Uniteds hubs are in Chicago Washington and Denver
It also has big operations in San Francisco and Los Angeles
Those are major gateways to Asia where it has a major presence
Tom Parsons CEO of Bestfarescom says the merger would most hurt consumers who fly in and out of smaller regional airports that are served by both airlines
Reduced service and choice in such markets are likely
Youre going to pay a premium for this merger Parsons says
The only way youre going to have lower airfares in num is if a lowercost airline comes to your city
If not expect to pay more
Its sad for the consumer
Seethu Seetharaman a professor of management at Rice Universitys Jones Graduate School of Business says its possible for mergers to reduce fares if they create economies of scale and savings get pushed down to the consumer

Lodick Mashile a surgical nurse for all his working life took to the picket line outside his hospital joining hundreds of thousands of doctors nurses teachers and other civil servants across South Africa striking for better pay
Mashile says he just cant get by on his num rand $num monthly salary and num rand $num housing allowance
The numyearold said he became a nurse num years ago because he wanted to help people
But I cant help people if I cant help myself he said Friday raising his voice to be heard over the blowing of vuvuzelas and chanting by fellow strikers at the gates of Helen Joseph hospital in Johannesburg where Mashile works
With the strike in its third day Friday clashes between strikers and police continued and army medics and ordinary South Africans answering a government call for volunteers served meals to patients cleaned wards changed babies diapers and helped retired nurses at public hospitals dispense medicine
Private hospitals which are not affected by the strike are taking some of the sickest patients
Many South Africans were aghast that the sick and frail were suffering because of the strike
We are horrified that care is being denied to the weakest and most vulnerable the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference said in a statement Friday
State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele told reporters that strikers accused of threatening other workers vandalism or other crimes would be taken to special courts
Dr Aaron Motsoaledi South Africas minister of health said it is unacceptable that striking nurses were preventing ambulances from entering or leaving hospitals
Even during the time of war people dont tamper with hospitals he said
But in a frontpage editorial the Johannesburg newspaper The Times said the government should consider paying highperforming civil servants better wages
Unions are demanding an num percent wage increase and a num rand $num housing allowance
The government is offering a num percent increase plus num rand $num for housing
In a statement Thursday the government said it could not afford to offer more
The government has given unions representing civil servants three weeks to accept its offer
Negotiations were continuing and it was unclear how long the strike might last
A public service strike in num lasted a month
This could go on as long as the one in num said Mashile the nurse
Mashile said he misses his patients but feels compelled to go to the streets because of his financial problems
Im always in debt he said
Five relatives including three children in primary school depend on his salary
Banks have told Mashile that his salary before taxes and housing allowance is too low to qualify for a home loan and he earns too much to take advantage of government programs to house the poor
Im in the middle he said
If Im the middle class I have to afford a house at least
A car its a luxury
Yet Mashile said he would advise young people to go into nursing
What I can tell them is that they are going to struggle in this field he said
I wont tell them not to go because we still need professionals to provide these kinds of services to our communities
Mandla Sidu spokesman for the health department in the province that includes Johannesburg said num percent of staff in the provinces num hospitals wasnt at work Friday

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court struggled Tuesday to decide whether a law barring support to terrorist organizations violates the First Amendment rights of humanitarian groups seeking to help them with peaceful solutions
The justices appeared split as they heard the longrunning case that pits freespeech values against national security concerns and has gained relevance since the Sept num num attacks
Justice Anthony Kennedy voiced concern that the government could prohibit advice to a terrorist group on how to obtain tsunami aid or even file a legal brief
Yet Kennedy noted the governments view that any help for terrorists may advance violent goals
He said This is a very difficult case for me
Solicitor General Elena Kagan defending the law that bans not only money but also training and advice to foreign terrorist groups cited Lebanonbased terrorists Hezbollah builds bombs
What Congress decided was when you help Hezbollah build homes you are also helping Hezbollah build bombs
Representing the Los Angelesbased Humanitarian Law Project among those challenging the law David Cole said his clients want to assist the Kurdistan Workers Party at the United Nations and to inform the Kurds of their international human rights and remedies
The US State Department designated the Kurdistan Workers Party a separatist group in Turkey known as the PKK a foreign terrorist organization
Tuesdays case tests the material support ban that makes it a crime to provide service training or expert advice and assistance to designated organizations
A federal appeals court found those disputed terms of the materialsupport law which traces to num and was bolstered by the num USA Patriot Act unconstitutionally vague
does not on its face seem to me to be something that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in their unlawful objectives Justice Stephen Breyer told Kagan
Congress thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and legitimate activities she responded further
the illegal and illegitimate goals
Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggesting she found the law too vague said Under the definition of this statute teaching these terrorist group members to play the harmonica would be unlawful
Kagan responded that there are not a whole lot of people
trying to teach alQaeda how to play harmonicas
Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to support the governments position
The end that Congress seeks to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist organizations he said

Americans have a complicated relationship with credit cards
The average household has nine credit cards
Most of us wouldnt dream of going on a vacation or business trip without one
But many consumers believe the issuers of those cards engage in practices that are deeply deceptive and fundamentally unfair
In response to widespread complaints President Obama signed legislation last May that imposed broad new regulations on the industry
Some of the most significant provisions in the bill take effect today
The provisions will outlaw some of the industrys most controversial practices says Austan Goolsbee economic adviser to President Obama
The law also requires credit card companies to give customers advance notice of significant changes in the terms of their accounts he says
Customers will have the right to close their accounts if they disagree with the new terms he says
Still the bill doesnt outlaw some practices that are particularly irksome to consumers
Heres a look at how the reforms will affect your credit cards
What has changed Credit card issuers can no longer raise interest rates on existing balances
For example if youre carrying a balance of $num with a num percent interest rate your credit card issuer cant raise that rate except under certain circumstances
In addition if you open a new credit card account the issuer cant raise the interest rate for num months
This provision is the most significant reform in the legislation and has the potential to save consumers billions of dollars a year says Nick Bourke manager of the Pew Charitable Trusts Safe Credit Cards Project
Starting now consumers can no longer experience enormous rate increases on money theyve already borrowed
What hasnt changed The legislation imposes no limits on the rates credit card issuers can charge new customers
Nor does it limit how much card issuers can raise rates on future purchases says Josh Frank senior researcher for the Center for Responsible Lending
The prohibition on retroactive rate increases means credit card companies are going to be more aggressive at changing rates on future purchases and rates in general for new accounts are going to be higher than they were says Ben Woolsey director of consumer research for CreditCardscom
There are also exceptions to the retroactivity rule
Credit cards can raise rates on existing balances if
The card has a variable interest rate and the underlying index such as the prime rate increases
In anticipation of the reforms most banks have moved away from fixedrate cards
In July num less than num percent of bankissued cards offered fixed rates down from num percent in December num the Safe Credit Cards Project says
The card has an introductory teaser rate for a specific period and that period expires
Youre more than num days late on a monthly payment
However the issuer must restore the old interest rate after six months if you make ontime payments during that periodFees
What has changed Credit card companies are no longer allowed to charge a fee when you exceed your credit limit unless you sign up for this service
Card issuers will also be prohibited from charging extra because of the way you pay your bills
For example you cant be charged a fee for paying your bill by phone unless you request expedited payment or ask for help from a customer service representative Bourke says
What hasnt changed Credit card issuers will still be allowed to charge annual fees inactivity fees and other types of fees Woolsey says
And an increase in those types of fees is a certainty says John Ulzheimer president of consumer education for Creditcom
Card companies are facing the loss of billions in revenue in overthelimit fees he says which means higher fees elsewhere and new fees weve never even heard of yet
What has changed Many borrowers have several lines of credit with different interest rates on the same credit card
For example you could have one rate for a cash advance another rate for purchases and still another rate for a balance transfer
In the past when borrowers sent in a payment issuers usually applied the entire amount to the balance with the lowest interest rate first
Now issuers will be required to apply any amount paid beyond the minimum to the balance with the highest rate Bourke says
Credit card issuers must mail or deliver your bill at least num days before your payment is due
Due dates must be the same every month
If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday the payment must be credited on the next business day with no late penalty
Banks can no longer use a customers average daily balance over two months to calculate interest a practice known as doublecycle billing
What hasnt changed When card holders have credit lines with different interest rates card issuers are still allowed to apply the minimum payment to the lowestrate debt
If youre making just the minimum payment this wont help you Bourke saysDisclosures and notices
What has changed Card issuers are required to give num days notice before raising interest rates changing certain fees such as annual fees or cash advance fees or making other significant account changes
Credit card issuers must provide borrowers with more information about the cost of carrying a balance
In monthly statements youll receive an explanation of how long it will take to pay off your balance if you make the minimum monthly payment
Your statement also will include an explanation of how much youll need to pay monthly to eliminate your balance in three years
Statements also must disclose the dates by which payments must be received to avoid late charges
What hasnt changed Card issuers can close your account or lower your credit limit for any reason without giving you advance notice Frank says
In recent months credit card companies have sharply lowered credit limits for thousands a trend thats expected to continue credit card analysts say
Still the new provisions will change some of the industrys most egregious practices Bourke says
Now If you use your credit card for purchases pay your bills and occasionally youre a couple of days late your card is not going to blow up in your face he says
Illinois may be one of the first states to start providing health insurance in a new highrisk pool funded under national health overhaul but enrollment will be limited eligibility requirements tight and coverage may not begin until late summer
Illinois Department of Insurance Director Michael McRaith said the state will manage the program carefully to make sure theres enough money to keep everyone who enrolls covered until Jan num num when the new health law will prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions
Illinois expects to receive nearly $num million from the federal government to start covering people with medical problems whove been uninsured for at least six months
The state estimates that num to num people will be covered in the new program
Many more are expected to apply for coverage
Its important to temper the expectations McRaith said
This is a transitional program with a finite set of dollars for the state of Illinois As a result we anticipate more applicants than the funds will allow us to enroll
No one can apply yet
Before the program can start federal health officials must approve the states plan
Then Illinois will seek bids from thirdparty contractors to manage the medical plan and pharmacy benefits program
Were hoping to begin enrollment in the later days of summer McRaith said
The states submission to the US Department of Health and Human Services gives clues to what the program will look like
It will be called the Temporary High Risk Pool separate from but similar to the states existing highrisk pool called the Illinois Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan ICHIP
Applicants for the new pool would have to have one of num listed medical conditions which include leukemia Parkinsons disease AIDS juvenile diabetes and chemical dependency
People whove been rejected for health coverage for unlisted reasons may qualify McRaith said but he cautions that eligibility is likely to be tight because of limited federal funding
Only legal residents would be eligible and enrollees would have to show a birth certificate green card or other proof they are in the United States legally
Under the federal law they must have been uninsured for six months
McRaith said applicants must answer in writing whether they have ever had health insurance and if so when it ended
If it ended within the preceding num months applicants will be asked to document when coverage ended
Trained staff will review applications and check to see if applicants can get coverage instead through an employer Medicaid or Medicare McRaith said
Illinois is proposing a plan with a $num annual deductible and num percentnum percent coinsurance
Enrollees would have one plan option a preferred provider plan
If an enrollee used a doctor outside the network he or she would have to pay num percent higher coinsurance
Its still unclear how much premiums will be
But the federal law requires that the new temporary pools charge no more than standard rates
Illinois will have a consulting actuary calculate a standard rate by averaging the premium rates charged for similar plans by the largest insurers offering coverage in Illinois
It will cost about $num million a year to administer the program depending on how many people are enrolled
Given the limited funding for the federally funded pool the objective and plan is to minimize administrative expenses and to maximize enrollment McRaith said
Conan OBrien may have missed his calling
The once and future late night television host laid down a scorching rockabillyflavored set Thursday night at Jack Whites Third Man Records and plans to release a vinyl album of the show
This is probably the most fun Ive had in show business a sweatsoaked OBrien told a crowd of about num before launching into a fiery finale of Eddie Cochrans Twenty Flight Rock with White
OBrien has been riding a bus around the country with his band on The Legally Prohibited From Being Funny On Television Tour a music and comedyfilled variety show while waiting for his new hosting gig at TBS to start
He left The Tonight Show earlier this year after NBC reinstalled former host Jay Leno
OBrien ripped through a rockin set with his ace band behind him and The Cocettes singing backup
White the leader of The White Stripes The Raconteurs and The Dead Weather introduced OBrien as a rockabilly legend in the making
Whites Third Man Records has a concert space as well as reeltoreel recording equipment
OBrien wore all black his unemployment beard and a light blue Fender electric guitar
He was comfortable and confident using the kind of salty language you cant get away with on TV as he joked about himself White and members of his band
He told the audience that in six months hes gone from hosting the greatest franchise in television history to touring the country in a bus to making a vinyl record
Im going back in time he joked
Next week Ill be playing Vaudeville and then Im going to be a steamboat captain
OBrien played it straight on about half his songs leading the band through strong renditions of several classics though he did add comedic lyrics to a handful of songs
He opened the set with Elvis Presleys Blue Moon burned through The Stray Cats Rock This Town and laid a comedy routine about his middle class upbringing over Presleys Poke Salad Annie
The redheaded host used The Redheaded Stranger Willie Nelsons On The Road Again to poke fun at his situation singing My old show againI just cant wait to get my old show again
He changed the next chorus to Off the road again dear God please get me off the road again before finishing the song with Thank you TBS for giving me a show
One of the nights highlights was his version of Radioheads Creep which he sang with an exaggerated British accent
This is the only way I can sing Thom Yorke songs as a numthcentury chimney sweep with a top hat and a smudge on my cheek OBrien said
A few bars in White trotted on stage with a top hat which OBrien wore through the song
That was so stupid he said
Midway through the set OBrien had soaked through his shirt and his hands were too wet to hold his guitar pick
His trademark curlicue widows peak was a wild mess
OBrien and White announced something special through Internet postings and a line of at least num people wrapped around the block and far up the street even though only the first num were allowed into the show
OBrien greeted the crowd when he showed up for soundcheck and White tossed bottles of water to fans from the roof of Third Man on a day when temperatures reached into the high nums
The first people in line showed up num hours before the show and the alley behind the studio had a party atmosphere with beer bottles and pizza boxes scattered around
This means everything to me
This was so cool OBrien said before leaving the stage to chants of Coco Coco
OBriens next stop is Bonnaroo this weekend
TBS is owned by Time Warner Inc NBC is a unit of General Electric Co

BristolMyers Squibb Co posted a slight decline in thirdquarter profit Tuesday as its restrained spending was offset by flat sales of its drugs lower income from its partners and bigger discounts to government due to the health care overhaul
BristolMyers which sells blood thinner Plavix the worlds second bestselling drug reported thirdquarter net income of $num million or num cents per share
Thats down nearly num percent from $num million or num cents per share in the yearago quarter
Excluding several minor onetime items the New Yorkbased company said income would have been $num billion or num cents a share
That beat the numcent expectation of analysts handily
However Bristols $num billion in sales was slightly below the consensus of analysts
They were expecting $num billion
Still the company confirmed its num profit forecast given in July for $num to $num a share or $num to $num a share excluding onetime items
BristolMyers said bigger discounts required for medicines the government buys for patients in the governments Medicaid program for the poor part of the US healthcare overhaul reduced net sales in the quarter by num percent or num cents per share
The revenue decline also was due to lower sales of Bristols No
num drug Abilify for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as well as for cancer drug Erbitux and Avapro for high blood pressure
In addition unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced revenue from overseas sales by num percent and Bristols share of income from foreign sales of Plavix which it shares with partner SanofiAventis SA fell by half due to increasing generic competition in Europe
Otherwise it was a relatively strong quarter for Bristol which won US approval of hepatitis B treatment Baraclude for liver failure caused by scarring and approval in Japan of its biologic drug for rheumatoid arthritis Orencia
Bristol has two other drugs with deadlines at the end of this week for US regulators to rule on new uses Sprycel for patients newly with diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia and diabetes drug Onglyza in combination with metformin a cheap widely used starter drug for diabetes patients respectively
The Onglyzametformin combo also awaits approval in the European Union
Sales of Onglyza launched in summer num have been disappointing so far hitting only $num million in the third quarter
But Plavix sales were strong at $num billion and sales of Baraclude and HIV drugs Reyataz and Sustiva all were up
